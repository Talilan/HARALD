This makes 1st worlders harder to control and harder to oppress than 3rd worlders, since 3rd worlders are used to being controlled/oppressed by the state, and 1st worlders aren't.

Starship Troopers is supposed to stimulate your mind not advertise a political order. Imagine how confused you'll be when you find out he had male-centric harems in Stranger in a Strange Land but had multi-generational marriages with multiple male and female members in other books like The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Which was his ideal? Probably neither. Not every work of fiction is a politically charged message and that is just fine with me.

If this was a man you wouldn't cry misandry, the misogyny doesn't make sense. A person is a person. They obviously tried to cuff her and she resisted. This is the next step. Police aren't going to take risks infront of a crowd with agressive people trying to hurt them, male or female. Killings by cop aren't common at all in Holland, like i said this is not the USA. It very rarely happens, not even one this year. The 6 cops were there for crowd control, as you can clearly see in the video. This is standard procedure. As little as possible arrest while the others make sure the crowd disperses. Cops won't use excessive force on me or a loved one as, like i said, cops are the most respected and trusted authority in the country. They score higher than other people and even neighbours. Things like this are very rare and excessive force therefore even more. She could walk and stand fine, there was no excessive force here, just the most efficient way to handle the situation. Even if the arrest wasn't correct, she abused the cop. The arrest can be wrong all you want, we both don't know, but because she abused the cop this was completely legal and no one will even look into it guarenteed. You respect cops here, even if they're wrong. If you're wrongfully arrested and you behave well you will most likely go free, there's a reason our prisoners per capita is one of the lowest in the world. Our judicial system is great. This is not the USA. Here's an article about our prisons closing because we have too little prisoners.

Some societies tolerate a version of it. Others will eliminate all signs of it with extreme prejudice.

Once corporations grow beyond a certain size and gain the ability to influence the politics of not just villages and towns, but states and nation states, **they need to be regulated, broken up, or, if nothing else works, nationalized.** When you think of free markets and libertarianism, don't think of some heavenly utopia.

1150,"Well said. Not at all crowdsourced. Not at all organic. SocJus is a specific, intentional, contrived post-religious faith. It was formed to create the base rank and file of useful idiots in a grand Alinsky strategy. They only thing crowdsourced about SJWs are how their norming dynamic works. They appear to be ""crowdsourcing"" recruitment or blue-pilling, or whatever. But, in fact, they don't convince anyone that way. SJWs are indoctrinated into the faith almost exclusively in college...a few in primary schools. (It is the academics who are the top of this whole insurgency). I suspect the confusion about crowdsourcing is simply a confusion with how this vulnerable group of mostly Millennial-aged young adults seek to enforce and maintain community norms upon one another. Thus, the twatter dogpile. Pretty much all other age-cohorts lack this dynamic by a large degree, including the generation following the Millennials...so it's not just a function of age/tech. Something very specific happened to Millennials, mostly in college, which radicalized them philosophically -- and which conditioned them to a permanent state of cyber-witch-hunts. Gen X missed out on this, so mostly ignore or evade it (from without). Boomers, well, .... meh.

""I enjoy videogames, but I'm not good at it and I don't want to be"" Alright then. Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. Multiplayer. At all. Play Singleplayer games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow. Make it fun for you, because singleplayer is ALL about you. Multiplayer isn't. If you do not want to shoot for greatness, if you do not want to become better at it, do not play multiplayer. Especially not with that attitude. If you ""do not want to be good"" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit. Same as a guy who, for example, during a group project would do fuck all, then lose the data he was asked to get and claim that the whole thing was his idea in the first place when it comes to presenting it, you will get a nice variation of ""fuck you, fuck your face, fuck your attitude and get fucked by the horse you rode in on you fuck"". Do not expect a pat on the head, a cookie and a participation trophy for ruining the fun of other people. You do NOT matter more than them and not giving the best you got and not actively trying to get better is an insult to your team. If you want to matter, and not have to get good, singleplayer is there for you. There are loads of guides on the net (google-fu is your friend), there are trainers, cheats, instructions, videos, maps, step by step solutions, you can always find a solution. But even in singleplayer games, depending on the game, the answer will sometimes be ""Get Better"". That game then might not be for you.

1438,"I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself. Now many of these people say things like ""so you can believe dragons and not muh female/gay/whatever characters??"", but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain. My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me. The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional companionship. Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws. It takes some self-awareness which a lot of the more SJW-inclined people don't do, because it makes them uncomfortable. So lets just take some women's march gender studies girl, with pink hair, who is vegan and freaks out a lot about random first world things. She will not be content with a character like herself, who would probably not be the biggest female warrior, strongest of them all. She wants the allmighty,, flawless heroine and will take any flaw in her as an insult against herself.",0
1439,">Why would a normal person seek validation from a weaker being? Incels believe they are weak. Well they are weak actually. But they could become strong. They swallowed the feminized culture and pursue a standard that was imposed on them. They grew up on feminist schools with girls who rejected them and mistreated them. Because of all the media most boys feel like incels until they lose their virginity. A lot of Chads dont realize initially they are Chads, and when they are young like before 16 they go through similar shit. So this all comes down to male disposability and a degenerate simpish society. This is what makes men believe they are weak and that is a lost battle, they struggle against themselves and other men for a trophy that is their own slavery, its all a big lie. >Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. It's funny looking back at how I thought I needed their assurance. Its not hard for men to beat women at their own game in dating. In life. In work. In sports. Everything. They just need to focus on that. But incels have a point, because society being gynocentric and now giving them jobs and positions, its making the life of incels hard because meritocracy is being forgotten in place of gynocracy. Meaning it matters less to be productive and hardworking but if you are the one who knows more people and you are more feminine and submissive, and at the same time you have no honor, you have some looks, thats what will get you the job. You see? So incels are indeed fucked, but its not in dating that they are fucked, they are fucked in life, in society itself. They would be once great fathers and great providers, even great soldiers. >my ex and others would express agreement or encouragement for my successes. Looking at it from where I am now, I was far beyond any of them in everything I did. I had more $, more degrees, a better career, and better everything else that I had EARNED. Me too i experienced the same with my girlfriends. But i also noticed one thing, they barely needed to put any effort in their lives to get ahead, be that socially, professionally or at the university. They were mostly retarded, but they were priveledged for having a vagina and they dont realize that.

1548,"I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it. And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it? More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and non-productive, but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc. So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like ""Ctrl+Alt+Del"" is just flat-out wrong.

""ASSAULT WITH HATE CRIME MOTIVE On January 11, 2018, I was on my way home from work at 5.30pm. I was in a hurry to get the son from school closing at 18pm. I'm in a hurry, the train is coming soon. walk through the barriers. A white middle-aged man in front of me, turns around and stops me in the middle of the barriers and says to me ""go on your own card."" I stand between the barriers, they hit me hard in my back. He blocks my way. I ""But I have a card"", and is about to show him, but there is no time to do it. In the next moment, I feel how he grabs me with both arms, squeezes me hard into a corner at the latches, pushes his knee to my body, preventing me from touching and holding me with both arms. I get scared! I push him away with all my power. He gets pissed off and says ""damn dirty N-word hora"" while pushing me so hard that I trip through the barriers. A black man runs forward and tells the white man to stop ""Beat a Woman"". I'm both afraid, angry, offended, shocked, sad and desperate. The man continues to call me N word hora. I defend myself, strikes back! I refuse to be violated, afraid and depressed. Everything is recorded on video. The man reports me for abuse and I am making a counter notification of abuse of hatred motives. A week ago, I received a letter home that my application was canceled but the husband's application to me is not canceled. Suddenly, I'm suspected of abuse. My report is closed because, according to the police, ""it lacks objective evidence of support"". The male's application is not laid down !! The police's racism has already determined that he (white man about 185 cm) is the victim, and I (black woman about 163 cm) is above, despite defending myself in distresses and the man started the attack on me from nowhere! It's me who has back injuries, was hospitalized because of shock, got sick, got colleagues who follow me to the track because I'm afraid to meet the man. It's me who was attacked by unknown white man in the subway, and subjected to an afrophobic hate crime. The police never investigated my notification as a hate crime and they never registered the hate crime scene before my notification was downloaded. In Sweden, about 25% of all racist hatred is avrophobic. The most common hate crime against black people is a violent crime of unknown white man. I am one of those victims who carry on the damage of racism, afrophobia and hate crime that the police are kidding in. I am tired of the institutional racism of the police, everyday racism, hatred and threats against black / brown people. I'm tired of 34 years in Sweden, to constantly bear the blame and become a victim of society's structural racism that permeates all authorities. I am sad that we who are exposed to racism never get settled. But the game must go on !!! SHARE GET! """,0

1682,"There's also 2 very distinct groups of Elves. The Aen Seidhe are the ones in the world the books and game are set in, they're very much downtrodden because comparatively they live longer but breed slower, so humans came along and just outbred them with numbers replenishing their losses faster. Then you have the Aen Elle, the Elves from the other world. The ones that make up the Wild Hunt. They're superior to the Aen Seidhe in almost every way. They're fucking huge standing at 8 feet tall or more whereas the other elves are often the same size or smaller than humans. They still have their war machine running and mages that can and will fuck things up. The Aen Seidhe take part in guerrilla warfare because they don't really have the numbers for anything else anymore. The Aen Elle show up on a magic flying boat, freeze everything solid, and then stab anything still moving. Then stab anything that isn't moving. Then set fire to everything just to make sure. If you're lucky enough to avoid all that, they might just take you as a slave to live out the rest of a very short life which will also wipe your memory even if you do somehow get away. They don't fuck around, and they're not to be fucked with. It takes the combined might of the most powerful spellcasters in the world to even stand a chance against them in the games, and the only reason they lose is because you cut off their political support in the forms of reinforcements. If Ge'els was still working with Eredin at the end of W3 it would have been a very different outcome. The Wild Hunt would have killed everyone, taken Ciri, probably then burned down all of Skellige, killed all the Nilfgaardians present which included the Emperor at the time, and then later would have invaded the rest of the world and wiped out everything standing in their way, human or otherwise. There is no good and evil race in the Witcher, that's part of the point. You have individuals or groups that stand out for those points but they don't represent the entire species. Even vampires have morally grey characters such as Regis and Detlaff, which is an unfair enough thing to say since they're not human and have very different ways of living, being very much more creatures of instinct than what humans are. Of the monsters in game most of them are more like animals than anything, killing for food rather than out of terror, and the exceptions to that are often being controlled by something else. Geralt specifically mentions he doesn't kill sentient monsters just because, trying to find a way to solve the problem involving them rather than just stabbing them until they stop moving. There are numerous examples of monster contracts where said monster did what it did because a group of humans decided to start shit in the first place. See the male troll in W2 that's mourning his wife the local humans killed for being a troll, or the succubus in W3 who killed some guards because they attacked her first, or many of the ghosts that are only ghosts because someone fucked them over in life. The single most evil creature in the entire game is probably something so powerful that you quite literally can't kill it. You can trick it and defeat it through a technicality, but that's it. You never in any standing hope have a chance at actually fighting and killing it since it's near enough the actual embodiment of evil in the universe rather than an actual living creature, and what does it spend most of it's time doing? Tricking people into making deals and selling their souls. Yes it can kill, yes it does kill, generally out of annoyance at someone wasting it's time, but despite being actual evil and the most powerful being you will ever meet in the game it doesn't just go around killing everything in sight just because it can. Even the Unseen Elder you can meet in W3, which is probably the second most powerful being in the game, doesn't randomly murder just because it can. You make it a point that unwanted attention on the vampires in general from what is happening would be a problem, despite vampires being so much more powerful than humans and yet it's a point the Elder accepts that point. This is a creature that can literally move faster than even witchers can react to yet it agrees to helping because it doesn't want things to cause trouble, and this comes after you do a quest where you see what just 2 ""normal"" Higher Vampires do against regular humans and you're lucky if you fight and kill 10% of the soldiers there because the vamps just mow down everything without pause. The Elder is above even those 2 in power and it still decides that not fighting is the better option. This is all of course stuff I don't expect the show to deal with. Race doesn't equal species for these people making the show, so the actual racism in the witcher world between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc will be probably ignored in favour of intra-species racism despite the outright stupidity that suggests when you have both actual different races in the world and monsters which are far more important threats.",0

2249,"It's an interesting argument, isn't it? Technically speaking, if you live with a man, you are more likely to get assaulted or attacked, because men commit more crimes like that. The logic is absolutely sound. However, it's *also* logical, in that case, to also write 'no blacks', because black people commit more crime, proportionally speaking, than white people, so if you live with a black person, you're more likely to get assaulted or attacked. I wonder if this woman would be happy to have the same logic applied to race, as she applies to gender. Or whether she would suddenly shout 'no way, that's racist!'. Another thought that I had is that, if we take it as correct that men are stronger and more physically dangerous than women, on average, that could work to your advantage, as well as your disadvantage, if you were a woman living with a man; this is because, if someone attacked you in your home (e.g. a burglary or something), the male you are living with would be able to defend you better than a woman could. It's a shame we can't have discussions about this rationally without it turning into an unpleasant argument. Anyway personally speaking I think it's unfair to judge someone based on their race, gender or sexuality, it's more important to meet the person and find out what they're like, than to look at what gender they are and instantly dismiss them based on that. But I understand women who are afraid of sharing with guys they don't know, I honestly do understand the logic. I would be wary of sharing a place with *anyone* I didn't know well, regardless of their race, gender, or sexuality; I think people in general are fucking awful.",0

Prisons are criminal schools. Plus it costs a lot of money to keep someone in prison.

It makes more sense to give them treatment, and only give a prison sentence for re-offenders. But I don't understand why they are singling out women. The policy surely makes sense for men as well?

No business is obligated to offer services to someone with whose views they don't agree, and though I would prefer this not apply to payment providers (whose only service is moving money around), unfortunately it does. The Unruh Civil Rights Act they cite makes no mention of political affiliation. It specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, mental or physical disability, age or medical condition (including HIV status). HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these characteristics. That being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell. If Paypal was discriminating against a guy for his choice of political candidate, maybe. But calling it illegal to discriminate against a guy for preaching 9/11 trutherism and Sandy Hook crisis actor nonsense? I don't see it happening.",0

She saunters upstairs to her room, screaming his name, no clothes on. She didn't seem very drunk, she must have been doing shots in her room or something, but she's dead set on my buddy's dick. Obviously he can't resist and they spend the night in her room. Party ends and I lock all the doors and clean up a bit before bed. I hear nothing, no screaming for help, nothing.

Western RPGs like those from Bioware and Bethesda get away with selectable gender because their main characters are purposefully basic as player avatars with all of the personality gets put into other characters met along the way.

2755,"I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it. There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western Massachusetts, mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was disproportionately burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley. Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people (overwhelmingly men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book ""The Jungle""? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book. If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket science. Incidentally, the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before. Right? If you look, you find all of the early women's rights heroines (who struggled!) *nearly all* of them came out of middle class households of the Victorian era. That was the first large group of women in human history to have free time. Consider the significance of that.",0

2986,"So just to be clear: About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1. The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised. The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront. Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war). Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage. She suffered no real risk. She just had to complain to the men in power. And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it. These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists. A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign). While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote. We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or proto-feminists, who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court disagreed. Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""] Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud. In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight. These included conscientious objectors from religious groups. (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz). The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so. Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered. Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male. Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy. Moreover it encourages ""gender equality."" Honestly, I don't feel hate. I just feel shame and disgust. Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.",0

Cool Also , you fucking illiterate dumbasses, the felony is called ""perjury"" and it's the same if a man lies about another man or woman or any other configuration you want. It has nothing to do with rape or about ""women having an advantage"" in the legal system (imagine being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this unironically). It also varies from state to state , and yes the minimum is typically 1 year, but under a federal case you get up to 5, depending on the intent you had when you committed said perjury,etc. And even worse, you can also get away with fucking rape with a 1 year sentence. Even if you actually did it. HUH, see i made a scary statement there. It's almost like we have this principle that guides how the justice system punishes people.... HUH Of course this all depends on what actually happens, and WHERE, and turns out judges actually consider all of this crap when making ruling since they actually more about their field than any of you fucking morons will clearly ever know about literally anything. And finally, of course, you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subject.

3680,"You really like putting words in my mouth haha, fascism, saying i would defend cops killing for no reason, saying i think cops are always right. It's clear that you're more of an emotional than a rational person, that's alright, but can you maybe base a single argument on something i actually said instead of just assuming everything? I never said any of that. You're assuming the cop thinks she's a lethal threat. Again, i'm sorry, but that's another dumb assumption. What is it with you and over the top assumptions? She is a threat, no one said anything about lethal. Ironic how easily you assume things about what i think but you can't assume the cops handled the situation in a proper fashion before the video began. You really have no idea what you're talking about, you're only defending her because she's such a fragile woman. Get over yourself, she abused a cop, this is justified by law and by public opinion. Crowd control is not something done only when crowds get aggressive, it's always done in case crowds get aggressive. It's called preventing a dangerous situation and it shouldn't be that hard to fathom. She was already under arrest, don't you understand that? She RESISTED ARREST. The didn't punch her first, arrested her after. They arrested her, she didn't comply with the arrest so they had to take physical actions. If you don't even know what an arrest is it's hard to talk reason with you. Arrest is verbal. When an officer says you're under arrest, you are arrested. She bothers the cops, is pushed away, she hits the cop, he defends, then she's arrested and then she hits the cop again, resisting arrest. You are one to talk about police violence, look at your own numbers and then look at ours, it's clear to see that lethal force is astronomically less common here than in the USA. Punching someone who punches cops is standard procedure everywhere. Tackling is way more dangerous, cop will be on the floor in a vulnerable position. But you don't understand anything about how police do their job so it's logical your emotions get the best of you. The cops are better than the people they arrested. Those people were being aggressive in bars, the handcuffed the first person without problems, then made sure the woman wasn't a threat anymore either. This woman, like you said, was in the wrong, and the cops were better. Cops should be better, and here they clearly were? The didn't attack anyone unprovoked (woman did) they only retaliated (woman instigated multiple times) and they remained professional and controlled the situation. Your entire argument is based on me saying police are always right, funny thing is i never once said that. You are an emotional person and paint the worst picture of the cops, and me, in your head with all your assumptions. Your argument is based on zero facts. Non-lethal measures against aggressive people resisting arrest within reason is never excessive force. It's amazing how you bend the facts so extremely. Everything you say ""i have told you"" i literally did not say and do not believe. You are arguing against an enemy you made up in your own head. Saying that police can't act until there's been a trial is ridiculous and you know that, don't play dumb. Cops have to act in an instance to take out a threat to ensure the safety of themselves and others, they did the right thing and you can't accept that because she's only a fragile woman (who ATTACKED COPS MULTIPLE TIMES)",0

This is why my response to them is not about cultural appropriation, it is about GET FUCKED WITH YOUR BOGUS FABRICATED POWER TRIPPING IDEOLOGICAL INSANITY.

All the indigenous people of North America can give up all use of metal, leave our grocery stores alone, and go back to eating meat and berries and fish and wearing nothing but leather and woven plant fibers they process by hand. Because that's how this actually works, if you want to actually add up who could be said to be ""appropriating"" from whom. The reality is there is no such thing outside the warped power tripping of SJW maniacs.

Not an emergency. You do not have calibrated eyes to test for speeds. You call the police directly and not the emergency line. Every highway has deaths on them from speeding it's not something special or new or important or even close to an emergency. Shouldn't hang up emergency calls but from the anecdotes given in the news post it seems like that entire region needs to be taught the difference between a emergency and a non-emergency is. That kind of call frequency of non-emergency on the emergency line is fucking stupid. 10 days in jail though it's kinda not long at all but then again unless someone was actually harmed because of her shitty work ethic, i'm not sure a longer prison sentence would be worth it. Fired and banned from that line of work would be a far better idea if no one was harmed. Prison sentence for being a shitty employee is kinda stupid",0

3918,"Many years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery. I don't know what the 'rules' are these days ... but she had gone through the entire procedure prior to getting the actual operation. Not the least of which was a lot of therapy and living full time as a woman for a minimum of 12 months. I think it was while we were waiting for her to be taken to theater that we were talking about it, and I asked if she thought the process was too involved. She told me (as best I can recall) that there were times when she felt that it was and was frustrated, but in retrospect that a lot of what was going on was designed to ensure that she was entirely sure about the choice she was making, and as well informed as humanly possible about the consequences. After the surgery (and after she had recovered from the anesthesia which had knocked her around a bit) she was happy. We lost touch a couple of years later, but she was still happy and I hope she still is to this day. I think, as you note, her being happy was because she had been given realistic expectations. Then we see people like Milo Stewart (a transtrender from youtube, if you weren't aware) who just wander off to an 'informed consent' clinic and start hormones with virtually no real preparation. And we see comments saying ""Your so brave"" and ""U r valid"" (yes ... they generally are that illiterate) and then down the track we see them start posting videos like >My Non-Binary Dysphoria Say WHAT? >Asexuality, sex and Kink Which starts with the sentence ""Hi! I'm an asexual and I have a lot of gay sex"". Seriously. >Am I still asexual?! What's my sexual orientation? The gist is ""I no longer identify as asexual"". No shit sherlock. >CONFESSION: I can't orgasm I wonder why? After which Milo had clearly stopped using testosterone and now their voice is all over the place.

Furthermore, coyotes don't have the option of using rational thought and empathy to recognize the chicks' pain and come up with a humane way to dispatch the chick. Humans DO feel empathy and we DO KNOW how to be humane, but we choose not to. Especially in certain countries. In the US, you can kill a chick or chicken fairly painfully, and with tremendous panic in the bird. In the UK, rules are more humane. This why the UK strictly regulates the nitrogen/oxygen gas mixture used to euthanize birds, so that the birds simply pass out without panic (as opposed to using a mixture or a gas that stimulates a panic response).",0

If youve ever watched the movie and just not quite gotten the parody theres a reason why; The movie itself parodies the fascist society within Heinleins book of the same name. This is the conventional wisdom about this movie. Except there is no fascist society in the book. It is portraying what is actually a liberal utopia. This is why, as the video explains, what we are shown of the government in the film, never once shows a fascist government. And despite being clad in nazi uniforms, the government is more transparent and liberal then any government on Earth, or in history. The reason this disconnect exists is because Paul Verhoeven **never actually read the book**. And this is a well enough known fact that it is actually on the Wikipedia page for the movie. Once again a favourite progressive talking point is complete nonsense and a pure fabrication.

A big problem with feminism is that is an ideology that convinces people that whoever dont agree with them completely are deeply morally/ethically flawed, and therefore their ideas and opinions can be discarded without consideration.

The focus was on preparing students to be able to apply theory, test it, and explain it while giving them some real world skills that could get them jobs.

4696,"I completely agree it has to do with maturity as well, but it's silly to disregard such a popular culture having an impact on youth. And this culture is celebrated constantly. People are subjects of their environment. When a negative environment exists, it's important to try to improve that environment. Keep in mind I'm a young adult as well. I make mistakes and I'm sure I have plenty of misguided opinions, but when something so backwards is celebrated this much across all races it surely has to be a concern. I also don't believe whites as a race are seen as authority anymore. I think authority has become a much broader term now. Once I was pulled over by a black cop after I picked up my good friend from his home in Camden. He's Puerto Rican and he was also with his friend who was black, who is also a good friend of mine. I got off the exit and was immediately pulled over for ""going 45 in a 50"". I can't even make this shit up. The cop ID'd both of my friends and never asked for mine, even tho I was the driver. They had to step out of the car and get patted down while I watched. Obviously this is a pretty specific and unique situation, but I do think this happens more than we want to believe and the moral of the story is authority transcends race. People in power will abuse the power regardless of race, as this cop did. And it doesn't have to be that way, I just think that's typically the way it goes down. Authority in this country needs to change, regardless of race.",0

To suggest that you're willing to back down, or restate your point, or change your viewpoint altogether if your listeners don't nod their approval. It's a nasty habit. It is the very opposite of confidence or assertiveness. It's gotten all out of control. These days even statements about which there should be no question or doubt are presented in this tentative, timid and deferential manner. Here's an example. I teach a 4th year university course in which part of the requirement is a seminar presentation. Students used to stand up and share the results of their research in a way that conveyed their confidence and knowledge. They no longer do. Even if they do feel confident, their culture now mandates that they dial it back and sound like this: My name is Jennifer? My seminar today is on bystander apathy?

4999,"Among the stupid shit Verhoeven added, changed, or left out to make it look bad. 1. Conscription is banned in the Terran Federation, ( I'm pretty sure it applies to the movie but it is never explicitly stated or stressed ), not only that, but you can quit anytime you want, even right before a combat drop (Though you won't get your citizenship). Heinlein was very critical the American Military's use of conscription and devotes several paragraphs to deconstructing it and even name drops the then contemporary Korean war as an example. All the more ironic when you consider Verhoeven's own misgivings about the american military. 2. In the book, the mobile infantry is an elite army utilizing orbital drop-pods, and power armor with enough fire-power to level city blocks, ( A formation with soldiers a kilometer apart is considered and dangerous risk for friendly fire, and at one point Rico uses mini nukes ) Essentially being WH40K Space Marines in all but name ( Minus genetic modification). That Is why they fight without tanks or artillery, which are explicitly stated to be obsolete compared to an M.I. soldier. The movie instead makes the M.I. look like the WH40k Imperial guard if it was led by Zapp Brannigan, rushing masses of ill equipped soldiers like a moron. 3. You don't need to be a citizen to have children. The only rights a citizen has over a civilian is the right to vote or run for office in the Terran Federation. 4. There are other forms of service apart from the military one can sign up for that will grant citizenship, though they are similarly dangerous, dirty, and grueling. 5. The Bugs are a technologically advanced race with an interstellar empire, not just some wildlife on an isolated planet. The attack on Sao Paulo is most definitely *NOT* a false flag, as the movie implies. 6. No attention is given in the movie to the near non-existance of racism, racial strife or sexism between humans in the Terran Federation. Units are mixed with people from all ethnicities and cultures. The Main character Juan Rico is in fact Filipino, though even book readers might miss this, as it is only inferred through two random lines where he mentions [Ramon Magsaysay](@url and that he speaks tagalog. Obviously Verhoeven couldn't let people think that anything other than globohomo peace and tolerance hippie ideals will lead to a internally peaceful society. 7. For the M.I. recruiting office, they hire only the most crippled and mangled veterans they can find. The one Juan Rico meets is missing half his face and 3 limbs. His job to scare away anyone who isn't really dedicated and to make it very, very clear what dangerous dirty and grueling life you will have in the M.I. which itself is *extremely* selective, only %9 of Rico's starting group is able to pass and complete training. There is no propaganda machine brainwashing people, and there are no illusions given that service will be anything but dangerous, dirty and grueling.

5003,"Starting off your argument with the irrelevant comment about my typing detriments your argument, as it shows you do not have much of value to say so u would rather talk about my typing. Men are the majority victim of every other violent crime. Yes sometimes we do worry about being kidnapped (men get kidnapped more than women tho u r right about the ass fuck part) and we do worry about getting mugged or killed, however unlike women, men are not constantly parading around telling everyone about our fears in order to get some sort of sympathy or special treatment. The only reason we bring these points up Is when WOMEN bring up how scary their lives are and we are tired of hearing their whining. I appreciate you bringing up points related to mens issues, however, to get back to your original comment when you said ""brock Turner used a pinecone is a bullshit arguement"", I was merely bringing up laws because she had decided to do so. If she had not talked about how women who rape men are technically not rapists according to law, I would not have brought up the fact that he was not a rapist. And also this is why I asked for her view about brock Turner. If she had ALSO said that he was not a rapist then there would also be no reason to bring it up. However she called him an evil rapist. Though he is evil and should rot in hell, to use her words""according to the laws"" he is not a rapist, which proves that she has put herself in a juxtaposition in terms of her views on the different issues, ultimately proving her bias against men.

So I guess it was less about feeling under appreciated and more about feeling a ton of stress to provide. Ive always been the breadwinner in our relationship, and I enjoy working and making good money. Actually just this year Ive opened my own business. I dont feel as respected as a breadwinner compared to a male counterpart. Many people I tell ask me how my husband feels, if hes okay with it. Some laugh, others pity me. We are happy with our dynamic and thats all that really matters. I understand you guys have a certain stance about women here.... and there are some women who fit that stereotype. But I encourage you to realize that, like men, we are all different. I dont expect huge gifts from my husband, nor did I ask for a big ring - actually I insisted we purchase fake ones. All this to say, there are great women out there. I know many. Same with men. Youre missing out on the most important human connection if you just write everyone off. Edit: more words",0

Whether the creators did it intentionally or not, their worlds are loaded with the idea at the core of white-supremacy: that having dark skin is bad. Bullshit. Firstly there were many settings about those other human sub cultures, where you played AS members of those ethnic groups, from Al-Qadim to Maztica. As for the idea that Orc bad because skin green, that's bullshit. There are any number of races with green skin & even darker shades of skin that were not evil, from Dryads, to some species of elves.

This is seen in the report under ""Classification issues."" This is an interesting case when you dig a bit deeper regarding their law. On one hand, I kinda get why they do this because it's a legal issue. The age of the two main characters here are 16 and 15 and this, **correct me if I'm wrong here**, is considered child porn. Although The UK age of consent is 16, The specific issue is that a 16 year old legal is having sexual relations with a 15 year old who is still a child, a legal-on-nonlegal depiction. Understandable that they would not want to stick their 2-inch pole in this deep, troublesome hole. On the other hand, the real issue lies with the stupid laws and provisions that are in place. They are drawings. Fictional characters. They are not real just like your waifus.Existing for as long as they're drawn. Just because a creator of a work has labelled characters a certain age that should not mean anything. The laws in UK and the general populace mindset regarding this thing need to change as they still treat drawings as having the same rights as a living, breathing, normal people.

[Source](@url It's a PDF document, although has no label as such, so if you try to open it with Adobe it should be viewable. So, continuing the argument, if you were to look in the document provided via the link above, pdf page 47 (page 41 in the document layout), you can find this quote: > Other countries, such as Poland, do not expressly state that the best-seller clause is limited to cases where rights have been transferred in exchange for a lump sum. Art 44 of the Polish act states that In the event of a gross discrepancy between the remuneration of the author and the benefits of the acquirer of author's economic rights or the licensee, the author may request that the court should duly increase his remuneration. Which according to Article 44 of the Polish Act, makes a rather solid case for Witcher's orignal writer. Not only will he have a case, he has a very specific article in Polish act that covers his exact situation, so he's likely to win that even. I'm obviously not endorsing what he's done, just stating facts. Edit: As people rightfully point out, it all depends on when the contract was signed, so if it was a long while ago, before the law I've referenced went into effect, then the contract would be valid and law wouldn't be applied retroactively.

I, too, openly question some of the views he expresses on twitter, like many of you on this forum. But you know what? it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if he and I don't agree on anything with regards to politics, if the man himself is so obviously full of integrity and understanding, his views don't really matter, I'll listen to what he has to say. That's the real trick, if its Anita Sarkessian, it doesn't matter what the message is. If she did a video on the long term benefits of flossing, I'd probably skip picking up floss the next time I'm at the drug store and might question the very foundation of dental hygiene as a science.

5951,"I'll copy/paste my [comment](@url Yeah, that guy's annoying. From what I've seen, the article on it was accurate. In fact, I read more or less most of the report myself. Now, what's discussed in this video is this article: @url Which I've previously ignored (because I've read the source). At the time the story came out, they put out 4-5 articles (I don't get it either, so don't ask me), and this article has had all of... 371 comments. The article I've read, however, has - up to now - 14,101 comments: @url And it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article: > Page 14 of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now control the majority of our conversations, but that these platforms “ including Google “ must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content neutrality. And this: > Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create well-ordered spaces for safety and civility rather than unmediated marketplaces of ideas. Personally, I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately: > The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the unmediated marketplace of ideas vs. well-ordered spaces for safety and civility. > The first approach is described as a product of the American tradition which prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility. The second is described as a product of the European tradition, which favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom. The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition. ""Claims x is the case,"" obviously isn't the same as ""argues x should happen."" And: > The briefing associates Googles new role as the guarantor of civility with the categories of editor and publisher. The only line I'm not sure would be this: > For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to expand globally. It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say ""argues."" For example: > US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the world. Another thing he objects to is ""Google admits."" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the ""Insights Lab"" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's ""internal research,"" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article: > Perhaps they buy Googles explanation that the presentation was just research and doesnt reflect official Google positions ” a confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers assessment of where the company is headed? I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh. Also this: @url",0

The lie being that the Republicans have been historically and are currently racist/fascist, that they switched sides during the Nixon administration, that racism was south vs. north problem (not a Democrat vs. Republican problem) and that Democrats are the party of tolerance and kindness. The evidence that he uses is -The voting record of each party on the amendments mentioned in the meme (I do not believe that the numbers are correct, though the ultimate point is. Democrats, in general, were opposed to granting rights to blacks.) - The racist/fascist history of the Democrat party (including voting against the amendments mentioned in the meme. Their support of the KKK (the militant arm of the democratic party). The passing of the Jim Crowe laws, and more.) - Democrat leaders fascination with fascist/socialist leaders such as Hitler and Mussolini. - Democrat president's racist backgrounds (which includes FDR, Woodrow Wilson, and Andrew Jackson). - How the Democrat party used wellfare to tear apart the family unit of the black population and set up a new, nation-wide plantation for minorities. - How cities and states run by the Democrat party tend to mirror the living conditions of slaves back in the pre-Civil war era. - How no republican ever owned any slaves. All of these examples (plus many, many more) are used to back up the point OP is trying to make.

6383,"In her defense, there was no reason for her to be slammed to the ground face-first. Just like there would be no reason to slam a dude face-first into the ground in the same circumstances. [Here](@url is a video from a different perspective showing the head-first body slam. Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to 0:30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective accomplished, and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or pussypasses. It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their head. American football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest 9 times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay? This could be your grandpa.",0

They will inevitably turn on you because you aren't black, or aren't genderfluid, or aren't mentally disabled, or your skin isn't dark enough... eventually someone more oppressed will come along and then you'll get labelled a shitlord and they'll turn against you. The biggest thing for me is that SJWs don't really seem to consume media either. They talk about it, but they don't seem to actually pay for it, which makes courting them pointless.

It's also cruel & unusual. An 11yo cannot consent, but it's also not violent forcible rape. What would they do if she had committed violent forcible rape? They can't give the death penalty, so they sentence her to 600 years? 60 is already a death sentence. And if she got death for violent forcible rape, what about someone who rapes and kills 11yo children? What are you going to do then? This is nothing but stupid Texas virtue signalling.

Is it true or not? >Stating that the court had found that ""the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims"" and ""amounted to a generalization without factual basis"", the Strasbourg-based ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of expression. According to wikipedia there's a source that states precisely that. @url#Aisha_bint_Abu_Bakr I guess wikipedia must be also breaking the law. >The court said it ""found in particular that the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant's statements and **carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected,** and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria."" this is where it hits rock bottom, people can have whatever feelings they want for whatever reasons, you shouldn't be responsible for offending those feelings specially when you're stating something that is sourced. An example I've seen is how Galileo also suffered consequences for saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, that also helped protect people's feelings and preserve religious peace. At this point it's an outrage that such court ruling exists, if people can't criticize a religion or ideology then it should also should be against the law to promote such ideology as well as it might go against people's ""religious feelings"" and ""religious peace"".",0
