The whole scenario of forgetting my compass and being nowhere with obvious reference points was only brought up because people started asking me why I didnt just go buy a compass. I ask a question that some people seem to think is so simple and obvious that it shouldnt have been asked at all. If it is so simple, why all the added attractions? Why not answer the question and get on with life? The posts that say go buy a compass as an answer to the question what if I cant buy a compass are, as stated, totally redundant. Sure, the first couple of posts that said that had their humorous undercoatings, and I can enjoy a good joke as much as anyone else.

Microsoft committed a large gaffe by not including this vxd file with Win98SE. Chuck, I am waiting for my mx-300 to show-up (ordered it, it will be here Monday I guess), but decided to try the drivers you mentioned above. At the moment, I am using the SB16 joystick port, which works with all joystick gear. Joystick resources are 0201-0201, no conflicts. The link you offered above (thanks, hell if I could find it), swgameen.exe is version 3.00, not 3.02. Dunno if that matters much. Also, the sw3dpro.vxd is version 3.00 (not 3.01). After installing swgameen.exe, my dang rudders -refused- to calibrate. Got rid of the joystick update software (restored from a backup), and all is fine again. Then I got to wondering; hmm, for all my joystick-gear, I use Microsofts generic ""Gameport Joystick"" driver (it is listed in System-Resources, also shows-up in the joystick-calibration screen (in joystick-calibration, there is no other driver option). Since you mentioned this sw3pro.vxd, I am wondering if I should ""remove"" the generic Gameport-Joystick, and ""add"" and try this sw3pro.vxd driver(?). If so, what is the correct Joystick-name (actually a driver) to add? In ""add new hardware"", after installing the update file above, there are many Microsoft Sidewinder-Pro drivers to choose from. Did I miss a step? Should I have tried a certain Microsoft JS driver (other than ""Gameport Joystick"")? Gotta laugh; this joystick update ""leans"" (heavily) on setting up Microsoft joystick/pedals/etc. Adds 17mb to the hard-disk too. It would seem MS would make a ""generic"" joystick update. Otoh.

David I am not sure that my views are that interesting, but Rummels figures for the USSR certainly exceed most estimates of Soviet excess death under Stalin. Currently most estimates converge around 20 million. The Soviet documentary records regarding executions, deaths in corrective labor camps, corrective labor colonies, prisons, special settlements, POW camps, etc. is much more extencsive than any statistical documents that exist for deaths caused by the Nazis. These recorded deaths in the Soviet records exceed three and a half million deaths in OGPU-NKVD-MVD custody. In terms of genocide, the Stalinist deportation of North Caucasians destroyed a percentage of the total population of the Karachais, Chechens, Ingush and Balkars almost equal to total world Jewish losses during World War II. Yet according to the great hero of ""anti- revisionists"" Deborah Lipstadt, ""In contrast, no citizen of the Soviet Union assumed that deportation and death were inevitable consequences of his or her ethnic origins."" Denying the Holocaust (p. 212). Her denial of this particular crime against humanity proves that ""anti- revisionists"" are not at all interested in truth or concerned about genocide denial.

27,"'Finally, it came time to build my Utility Diskettes. And it was now that I unfortunately had a total failure! Almost immediately upon starting the function, I am getting an error message popup that says: An error occurred while copying system files. Utility disks cannot be created. In Warp 4, the original ""Create Utility Disks"" program was something called ""bootdisk.exe"" and created four utility diskettes using the original files on the install CD-ROM. Then, starting in fixpack 5 or so, IBM added a little check box on the second ""Source Directory"" screen which said ""Use files from hard disk if they exist."" The reason for this was to use the most up-to-date file versions installed from fixpacks in creating the utility disks rather than the downlevel GA files. A great idea but a bug in the program prevented it from working if you checked the box. If you dont check the box, the 4 utility boxes are still created from the GA files like always. Apparently this bug is fixed in fixpack 12 for Warp v4. I suspect that the Create Utility Disks program in Warp Connect has a similar bug. Try it with the box unchecked and see what happens. If that does not help, look at the source directory for the utility disk files. Did you install from CD-Rom or diskettes? Is the letter of the source drive correct or has it changed during your new installation? Is the CD-ROM or install diskettes physically in the source drive? The program will terminate if these things are wrong. I doubt that your video install method had anything to do with the create utility disks program. The program is basically pretty simple and just copies a lot of files.'",0

OS20MEMU works fine here with Warp 4 FP11. Michael OS20MEMU is not gonna work on Warp 3 beyond FP 17. Period. It was well documented by IBM at the time and was the final straw that drove me to Warp 4. (Note that this is probably over 2 years by now.) Following is my experience. YMMV. If so I would like to know. Whether OS20MEMU works on Warp 4 is not dependant on FP level; it is dependant on how much RAM youve got. I am at FP9. Up until a month ago I had a 486DX2 with 24M on a Zeos Gosling MB. OS20MEMU worked flawlessly. I swapped out the old MB for a Soyo 5EHM K6-III 400 with 128M. OS20MEMU stopped functioning. Unlike the Warp 3 case where it displayed error an message that it was not gonna work, in this case it simply fails to produce any useful output. I dont think this is true. What I found was that one of the IBM1S506.ADD releases (and those do come in the fixpacks, too) broke OS20MEMU! To get it working again, use, for example, the DANIS506.ADD replacement, or get an SCSI system :, or use an older IBM1S506.ADD if you only have smaller IDE drives, so that you dont need the fixes in the newer releases of that driver. I think the problem is the zombie DOS VDM that is started by the newer IBM1S506.ADD drivers at initialisation, but cannot prove this. I once had a very short newsgroup conversation with Sam Detweiler about this, must have been 1997 or so, when the problem started even with Warp 4?

46,"'[snip] Luckily for us in the FreeBSD camp, though, it is not as popular as Linux. That sort of makes FBSD immune to Microsofts FUD campaign, which is aimed squarely at Linux because of its popularity. Linux is taking the heat of the MS vs. Free Software competition. For example, when has MS ever complained about FBSD taking over their ""territory""? You also never hear about MS releasing documents claiming Windows NT is better than FreeBSD. Here, Linux has the misfortune of bearing the ""cross"" of the free software movement. Very WELL put. Like I said before, I am not saying that people running one Free Unix should like ALL Free Unices equally just because they are running Linux, FreeBSD, etc. in fact, it is perfectly healthy to think FreeBSD sucks and Linux rules. A person cant run them both. it is OK to have preferences. (Over in comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc, there is a lot of flaming going on over which is better, easier to install, easier to use, etc.) But I think that FreeBSD is a benefit to Linux, and vice versa. For example, FreeBSD would never have had the massive amount of free software (such as xemacs, WindowMaker, gcc, to name a few) if it werent for the demand for this software created by people running Linux to begin with. OTOH, having BSD in addition to Linux might create just enough of a free UNIX user base that companies would decide to port their software to Linux. Most of the time, Linux software will run on FreeBSD nearly as fast as it will on Linux. In fact, I am running the Linux version of NS Communicator 4.7 on FreeBSD (check the header. it says Linux.) So, all companies have to do is distribute Linux binaries of their software, and they will run on FreeBSD. In fact, I believe Linux at one time had the limited capability to run FreeBSD binaries, and that this emulation is currently broken. I dont really see the need for Linux to have BSD emulation, though, because it is so much more popular than BSD. FWIW, our local Linux users group has 2 FreeBSD users which are more than welcome.

47,"'It sounds as though you are arguing that the supply is very inelastic wrt price. Why would you expect that to be true? Gold mining is a very expensive operation, and how deep it is worth going, how low a grade of ore it is worth processing, etc. depend on the price. Because almost all the gold dug up the past 5000 years is still above ground and part of the current ""supply"". The amount of new gold mined every year barely increases the total. The size of the world economy has something like doubled in the past decade or two. But the gold amount in circulation hasnt. But if the econonmy grows faster than the amount of money in circulation, you get deflation. And contrary to what monetarists and gold bugs say, deflation is bad. 5% inflation are a nuisance, but 5% deflation means that the economy is in deep shit. Run that by me again. If suddenly everybody is rich, this is a bad thing? Okay, granted, it cant last, but in the meantime it is all good. So please tell me why deflation is a bad thing. Deflation leads to money hoarding, which draws more money from the market, leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible, buying only the baremost necessities, and this as late as he can. The result is, of course, collapse. Talk me through this, okay? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5% more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5% more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing? No, my friend, if you truly think that, then you are obviously no student of human nature. Your argument against deflation is that ""it leads to money hoarding.""

In point of fact, there is a very fractious debate as to whether it is at all acceptable to some Muslims for Christians to even participate, much less teach, in a Muslim art. Even from the Muslim point of view, there is much of the aboriginal animist/shamanist coloration to the art. The practice of Islam in Indonesia is certainly much different from it is practice in other geographic areas. Our specific association is Christian in nature, and that of only a particular coloration; joyful in it is expression. We also dont seek out certain occupations to become affiliated- it is sufficient that a man choose a certain occupation to indicate that many of his other life decisions would be at odds with what we practice.

Therefore, in order to produce a ""scientific proof of God"" you are also going to have to discover the ""scientific definition of God"" at the same time. So what [Hammond]So I have discovered it. Thats what. we are really talking about is the ""scientific discovery of God"" not simply the ""scientific proof of God"". When Chadwick discovered the Neutron he didnt discover the ""scientific proof of the Neutron"" he discovered the ""definition of the Neutron"" at the same time that he discovered the ""proof that it exists"". The same is true with God; as a scientific quantity. I do perceive another of those apples and oranges comparisons. As with many other discoveries, at the time time of the discovery of the neutron, it had no yet been defined. What we in Western society think of as God, however, has been defined and redefined over the last several thousand years. [Hammond]Not scientifically it hasnt. Philosophically, Psychologically, Theologically maybe, but not ""scientifically"". What ever you are describing, I cannot tell, but it ceratinly doesnt sound like the God I have read about and heard about. You can call it whatever you will, but unless it fits the classic description, it is not the God everyone has been arguing about proving or disproving for so long. [Hammond]I agree with that statement 100%. The ""scientific quantity"" must be obviously reconciled with the 5,000 year, 50 billion person historical opinion of God. In fact it is. The 4th order (Final) Psychology factor is a social psychology factor which EXACTLY fits, the 1,000 page description of this factor in the Bible. The Bible basically defines God as an ""invisible perfect man"" who has ""spiritual power over ordinary human beings"". This is what the 4th factor is, since the direct cause of it is the ""growth curve deficit"" see: This shows that the difference between a ""perfecdt man"" and us ""average men"" is the (universal) brain growth deficit. therefore this ""perfect man"" lives within our ""averagely developed"" body. ie. is the latent or ""ungrown"" part of our brain. this causes a ""latent or ungrown"" part of our MIND (sometimes called the unconscious mind) which is the ""spiritual force"" which guides us.

When you sharpen a tip on a 6"" long tungsten welding electrode, which may be anywhere between 1/16"" and 1/8"" thick, and the other already sharpened end is in your palm, the tip in your palm burns you before the bulk much closer to the sharpened point does. How come the heat obviously travels inside this material toward the far end? Regards Slavek. I thought heat was caused by over-stimulated molecules. Heat is energy. Energy can be released by a variety of things. No molecules, no heat. There is a classic demonstration concerning heat: two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror, travels through a distance to the other mirror, and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system, and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror, and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the ""heat"" radiation that is gathered by one mirror, passed through the glass, and refocussed by the second mirror. Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic, randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments (their internal bar magnets). Tom Davidson Aurora, CO'",0

There are differences, but nothing of 5% magnitude. I suppose the weight gain was arived at mathematicaly from the behaviour of the pendulum, rather then from weighing the pendulum on a spring scale. One has to be carefull with drawing the conclusions when mathematics is used. I still think though, that the thermal radiation is the main product of random material behaviour while the gravitation is a different quantum order byproduct. Regards Slavek. Gravity, according to my Ordered Freedom theory, is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large, spinning, cold (below 77 K) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2% weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse, Saxl observed a 5% weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work.

I know the conventional wisdom says, ""No"", and in this case I am included to agree, based on views through a high quality 6 inch refractor and VERY steady seeing conditions. On a few nights over the past several years, seeing conditions at the observatory were such that on one night I could see very thin shadows on the walls of craters on the moon several hours before Full Moon. On those nights I experimented with pushing the mags past the 80x per inch aperture limit, and found that while the image was magnified, I could not see more detail on the Moon, Mars, or Jupiter (on different nights). And on an SCT optical system, with that large secondary, I have not successfully seen more detail at mags much higher than 40x per inch aperture, through a C8 or a C5+, despite excellent seeing conditions. Yes, the image was larger, but I could not see more details. So I conclude that you can save your money on short focal length eyepieces and just learn to see more details at lower mags. I am oh so tempted to add a 3mm TV Radian to my C8. It would likely be the last eyepiece I will ever buy for any scope, but used to be sure there is nothing left to see, and to occassionally get lucky. Tell me I am crazy? Naw, you are not crazy. Under superb seeing conditions, I have used up to 1000x on my old C-8. Observed Mars with a 2.5mm Zeiss that Markus Ludes carries around in his pocket and the image was beautiful.

The problem with religions is that they project human aspects on to the divine entity. It is a concoction of insanity, hallucination, hypocrisy and fear. Getting even with divinity for the alleged creation and bringing us into a torturous life. Thusly putting divinity in the lap of a virgin, torturing, crucifying and killing then resurrecting and asking for salvation. Sexual frustration as well is deeply rooted in religions. Making ""GOD"" a male entity is sexual projection from both sexes not from males only. Eve eats from the forbidden tree but ""God"" stays silent, blind and deaf. Yet when she gives Adam to eat and he does, Pops up the GOD for challenge, male to male. Adam defied Gods will. So, as far as proving the fallacy of religions at any time, is very easy. You are skeptic about disproving the fact of divinity in the primordial sense. Here I have to agree because the basis of consciousness and self awareness of life must have its roots in the primordial fabric from which we are made into the zenith of complexity. So, such a divinity is inseparable from beingness but does not interfere like complex beings except through complex beings. We are the Gods that we describe and we do exist, hence the conflict is only conceptual. That is why the debate never ends while you argue with those drunk with the above described concoction.

She does this because in her mind murders based on ethnicity are morally worse than murders committed for other reasons including random and arbitrary quotas. This itself is a very dubious moral postion. In order to make the Shoa appear morally worse under these conditions it is necessary for her to deny the ethnic component of Stalins murders. The Soviet documentation on the deportations is quite clear that the deportations were undertaken solely for ethnic reasons, not political reasons, not randomly, not arbitrarly and not for military necessity.

[Forgot the correct name for such ice fragments in english] The same will be for 1Ton bomb vs 1M, 1gr TNT fragments. What do you think will do more damage in a city? A single 100 Ton bomb or thousand 100 kg bombs, scattered across the city? It is the second, not the first. You are right. [though, never heared on 100 Ton bomb. Neither did I, that was a thought experiment only. I noted you used ""only"" 1000 as a scale.] Yeah. Anyway, what I really wanted to illustrate is that ""destructiveness"" is not a simple, monotonic function. If youve a given amount of ""destructive energy"" available, maximal destruction level will be obtained when you subdivide it into packets of size sufficient to destroy or severely damage an individual target. If the packets are significantly larger than that you get an overkill and total destruction is reduced (since there are fewer energy packets). Smaller than that, and the destruction is reduced again. Thus the issue of ""what is the target?"" enters into this. In the case of the comet I would distinguish between surface destruction (wiping out towns, forests etc.) and seismic destruction where the hits are sufficiently powerful to crack Earth crust and cause earth quakes and vulcanic activity. A switch with your permition. In a privious post you were addressing vaguely to the predicted ejecta as optimistic. I wonder if you can elaborate whether you can actually estimate a crater size/shape vs velocity, mass, shape, energy release rate, impact cross section, target material and structure? If you have some rule of a thumb for such estimation please post or mail. An upper and lower barriers/limits are welcome too. I really dont know how to do it. An extremely complex problem, for sure. I would guess that military must have some information to the effect, if only empirical one. . To my knowledge, no such impact scale was ever directly observed and measured in real time. Other that. All the non-military data, involves highly extrapolated calculations on small scale experiments or on simplifications to enable computation. Then it is the military data thats needed.

However, when I telnet to port 25 from behind the firewall my machine does respond. It is only when I telnet to port 25 from outside the firewall that it doest respond. Is there a reason why my machine would respond to a request from inside the firewall, but not to a request from outside the firewall? And only do so for port 25 (port 23 and 110 work fine)? thanks. p.s. I am running RedHat Linux 6.0 Is your firewall set to allow traffic through port 25 from the outside? Most of the firewall setups for home networks are set up to allow unlimited traffic from within the private network, but block traffic from outside except at specified ports.

250,"'20 years ago, there wasnt the market for more than a handful of full time audio practioners, but today anyone with some creative musical talent can be one. The cost of putting music into distributable form (this is the bottom line of the ""audio practice"" we are talking about) has become almost negligable, allowing more people to buy into the business and spend as much time as they need to in order to make a living. R.A.P. tends to be kinda ""album-centric"" and I wonder if thats why I sometimes see things a little differently. Most of the work I do has nothing to do with making records. Some of it is recording TV shows, some of it is dialog/voice-over work, some of it is taking music recorded by others and molding it into new shapes and sizes. Some of it is also live, but the analog vs. digital debate is somewhat less significant in those circumstances (though still not irrelevant). I probably _could_ do more record work if I could get over this case of ADAT-in-garage-aphobia. I agree that there is now room for more audio workers than there used to be, but bear in mind that we are not all self-producing album makers. I deal with the same reliability, compatibility and deadline issues as a commercial music studio, but the processes (and to a certain extent, the objectives) are different.

One Christian gentleman I spoke to thought it was ""The Theory that man decended from apes."" Not quite. Evolutionary theory says that man and monkey are cousins on the tree, not father-son. The stipulation makes sense because humans and the greater apes share nearly 99% of their genetic code. Before there were men, or women, or apes, there was something that was sorta monkey like. Some of it is decendants had to stay in the trees and eat fruit to survive. Over millions of years, they became modern apes. Others were forced to go hunting on the plains, and use tools and fire. These lost their body hair, gained inteligence, and grew eventually into mankind. This did not happen overnight. Any casual observer would be long dead before any noticable changes happened. Basically, macro evolution is repeated separated micro-evolution until the two groups of creatures can no longer interbreed. Scientists call this Speciation. The last thing I have wondered is why Christians refuse to accept evolution, as if it were forbidden by their god or something.

293,"'THIS IS A LONG ONE Well, not necessarily new, but new enough. I am looking to train in a form of martial art. In the past, I had studied for several years in the style of Ishin Ryu karate, but had to withdraw from courses due to a hip injury. This was nearly 6 years ago. I have decided that it would be a good idea to begin studies again, while I am still relatively young. However, I would like to begin anew in another style. The problem is, with hundreds of styles and forms and variations on those, it is hard to decide. So, my first question is, what would be your recommendation. To help you decide, here is some background on myself and what I am looking for: I am near 63"" in height. I would consider myself medium build (a little above average, I bench just over 200 and curl just over 100, so think of someone like that) and weigh around 200 pounds (although I tend to deviate, and am currently losing). As far as speed and flexibility, I am still above average, even at my weight. Also, I am 19 years old, so all my joints and bones are still in good shape. As far as what I am looking for, there are a couple of factors: 1) Usefulness 2) Health I want something that is not just for show. If I were to ever be assaulted or something like that, I would want to be able to defend myself. The one problem that I saw with karate is that it was such a hard style that the only way I could really defend myself was by pulverizing the attacker. I would like to have an option to use hard force if I must, but to also defend myself without injuring anyone if at all possible. (It may seem a little juvenile and impractical, but I would also be interested in training in a weapons style at some point, as I find it very interesting) It would be nice, also, to train in a style that would improve my overall health. SO, if you have any advice for this lost kid, please let me know. I would as I dont often have time to check the groups, and feel free to ask any questions to help you better advise me!

I got increasingly bizarre error messages and the system is now totally wedged. HOW DO I BACK OUT of a fixpack from the text-mode command line accessible early at boot time? The system wont go any further. More detailed history and symptoms: The system started at FP11 and has a new CDRW (SCSI) that replaces a CDROM (IDE), but that configuration was working for 2 days prior to FP12. The RSU installation went as far as the reboot. First problem was that it announced that device VCSHDD.SYS was bad. Pressing ""enter"" lets the process continue, and all the other device drivers load, but then the system comes to a crashing halt (C-A-D does not work) with the message that: ""The file PMMERGE-PMVIOP.122 specified in the PROTSHELL statement on line 2 of the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a valid program. Line 2 is ignored. System stopped."" Now, the CONFIG.SYS does not contain any such nonsense, its line 2 is the perfectly normal PROTSHELL=C:\OS2\PMSHELL.EXE I would rather not have to reinstall everything from the beginning! Pierre The Cucumbers ""Total Vegetility"" is out! Pawnshops ""Three Brass Balls"" is out! RAW Kinders ""CD EP"" is out! Gosh, Pierre, I dunno. Trevor Hemsley is an absolute expert in this area. I just finished several hours with a Warp City member who is finally back online. He had upgraded to FP12 without a problem then tried the beta release of SDD and it it screwed up video. He didnt want to but had no other recourse but to reinstall OS/2 from scratch. Once reinstalled he tried upgrading to FP12 and hit a trap error and the system would not go on any further. He couldnt back out the FP12 so he reinstalled again and posted in the setup newsgroup. There Trevor advised he rem out the sound card statement and try again. By then he had contacted me and I advised he upgrade the sound card driver before upgrading to FP12 again. He did that then tried FP12 and it worked. Before starting that RSU IBM should offer a small Uninstall program for download just in case. The WC member was so frustrated he was ready to throw in the OS/2 towel. Trevor is here: Tim.'",1

Ron ""Sacred Cows make the best hamburgers"" ""To judge from the notions expounded by theologians, one must conclude that God created most men simply with a view to crowding hell"". - Marquis de Sade I do not believe that God can be detected, observed or analyzed at this time, nor do I believe that at this time science can disprove his(its) existence. The problem with religions is that they project human aspects on to the divine entity. It is a concoction of insanity, hallucination, hypocrisy and fear. Getting even with divinity for the alleged creation and bringing us into a torturous life. Thusly putting divinity in the lap of a virgin, torturing, crucifying and killing then resurrecting and asking for salvation. Sexual frustration as well is deeply rooted in religions. Making ""GOD"" a male entity is sexual projection from both sexes not from males only. Eve eats from the forbidden tree but ""God"" stays silent, blind and deaf. Yet when she gives Adam to eat and he does, Pops up the GOD for challenge, male to male. Adam defied Gods will. So, as far as proving the fallacy of religions at any time, is very easy. You are skeptic about disproving the fact of divinity in the primordial sense. Here I have to agree because the basis of consciousness and self awareness of life must have its roots in the primordial fabric from which we are made into the zenith of complexity. So, such a divinity is inseparable from beingness but does not interfere like complex beings except through complex beings. We are the Gods that we describe and we do exist, hence the conflict is only conceptual. That is why the debate never ends while you argue with those drunk with the above described concoction.

Right now I am thinking of installing a SonicWall/DMZ and need to make a decision on whether I should let SMTP trough the FW to my Exchange server (dont like the thought) or using relay, but dont want to put a NT box into my DMZ just for relaying when a linux box does the same better and cheaper. I have some experience with setting up Linux as a DNS and web server in a lab environment, but sendmail makes me shiver . Thanks, Daniel Sidler to reply via e-mail, remove xxxs from address. Say no to spam. Gregg, With sonicwall/10 (w/o DMZ) I think you can just open one port (SMTP) to the mail server through the firewall. This does allow anyone to exploit any hole they find in the MS Exchange IMC, but the rest of the services on the exchange machine should be blocked. Personally, what I do is run use a dual homed web server (IIS4) which is connected outside the firewall (and has nothing useful on it) to relay mail. IIS4 includes a very limited SMTP mail server service which I have set up to relay mail to our domain (it will not relay any other domains). Our DNS MX entry points to the relay machine. Since all mail is immediately relayed to the exchange server, the relay machine never has any mail (other than a small queue) on it and it has no user accounts on it. You may want to put together a cheap linux or Windows system that relays mail from outside the firewall to accept/send mail. There appear to be plenty of free/cheap SMTP mail servers available. That way if it becomes compromised there is not much there worthwhile. includes a built in email proxy that does this (but it is more expensive than sonicwall and you have to supply the hardware). David Abrams We have a single NT4 (SP5) LAN server running file&print, Exch 5.5 sp2 (uses ETRN on IMC to retrieve from ISP - works great), IIS4 (intranet only) using Wingate 3.0.5 and 56k modem as DOD router/firewall. We are now moving to DSL and therefor needing a real firewall solution. We have MSProxy v2 license available and are considering using SonicWall-10 also.

I am trying to understand how wide angle lenses, especially Fish-eye lenses work, and am having a tough time finding resources on the net. Some of the questions I am trying to find answers for are: 1) What gives a lens a wide angle of view? Is it just the small focal length? I guess when the focal length decreases, the cone of light that converges at the focal point is wider? But then, a 14mm lens is not 14mm long, or is it? 2) What is really happening when you have a view angle of 180 degrees, as in the case for a fish-eye lens? It would seem like the focal point is now inside the lens, since the ג€˜coneג€™ is now a half-plane ג€“ but then how is the image formed? What type of projection gives you the circular, distorted image formed by fish-eye lenses? It looks similar to the image formed by the surrounding environment on a reflective sphere. 3) What is the difference between diagonal and circular fish-eye lenses? 4) I know that in 3D computer graphics, the perspective transformation can cause objects to look distorted, depending on how you set your projection parameters. Some of the wide angle lens manufactures say that they have corrected for distortions. Are these distortions really ג€˜distortionsג€™ in the sense that the way you are trying to project the image, may be these distortions are ג€˜naturalג€™? I am not talking about engineering defects, but the effects produced by the projection itself, the extreme case being a fish-eye lens. 5) Where can I find information on lens construction, not just the basic lens equations, but some information on how these lenses with floating elements and such are designed? Hope that wasnג€™t a question too many! Iג€™ve been think about this for a while, and I would be grateful if the experts here could clear up some of these concepts for me.

The grappler/striker debate has been waged repeatedly in this NG. I reserve comment in this regard. In the Okinawan Karate systems that I am familiar with, beginner waza typically focus on block, kick, punch. The throwing, grappling, pressure points, etc are usually introduced at a more advanced level. Check with the yudansha in your dojo to see if they indeed have this advanced bunkai in their portfolio. Not all instructors have this knowledge even though it is contained within the system. Often those who do have this knowledge will introduce it later in the training. One tool that I introduce early on is change body (dodging). Learning to move, get out of the way and position yourself favorably will be beneficial no matter what an aggressor throws at you. Later on, change body provides an entry for more advanced things like grappling, throwing, joint and point manipulation.

One big thing people overlook in a deflationary cycle, your income goes down. Companies will cut pay too at least match the level of deflation. Deflation leads to money hoarding, which draws more money from the market, leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible, buying only the baremost necessities, and this as late as he can. The result is, of course, collapse. Talk me through this, okay? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5% more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5% more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing? No, my friend, if you truly think that, then you are obviously no student of human nature. Only if prices drop to match the deflation rate. The prices that do drop should be food and very little else. Most durable goods price will remain the same until companies can figure out a way to drop them without going bankrupt. Your argument against deflation is that ""it leads to money hoarding."" This is patently untrue, thus your argument has no base. Unless I am missing something.? Income drops as Companies cut pay or have massive layoffs. Large Companies would be very hard hit. They are stuck with inventory and products that are highly overpriced and they cannot cut prices with the suddenly increased debt hanging over them. The last great cycle of deflation was called the Great Depression. Hardly good times for the country.'",0

If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year, I think we might be in business. What surprised me is that the team has more depth than last year even with injuries and holdouts. This was only one game, but the roster itself simply looks better than last years to me. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail, but I liked what I saw in Hawgood, Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars, but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me, but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. Steve Kariya did well too, in my opinion. I see why he made the team. Mogilny had some jump himself ! I bet losing ten pounds was only a good thing for him. I remember that Stephane Quintal did this last year and he instantly got more jump on the ice. It is so much easier to skate around when you got ten less pounds to carry. And he was more aggressive. He needs to go straight to the Net sometimes, though, not just wait for the late man to take his pass. He scored more than 50 goals in the past, he should take shots. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE, which was what I doubted they could ever do. That center line seems better to me with Messier, Cassels (happy to see this guy, I like him) and Bertuzzi. It is the first time we seem to have some depth in. years and years.

495,"'. There is a classic demonstration concerning heat: two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror, travels through a distance to the other mirror, and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system, and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror, and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the ""heat"" radiation that is gathered by one mirror, passed through the glass, and refocussed by the second mirror. So is it a direct tranmission of some form of energy from one match to the other, or is the energy that lights the second match derived from energy transfers within the mirrors? Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic, randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments (their internal bar magnets). Would the magnetic flux created by current flowing through a non-ferrous conductor be affected by heat, assuming the conductor itself was not heated? Assuming what ever created the magnetic flux was not influenced by the external event, what sort of events could affect a magnetic flux? Dave Nelson'",0

536,"'I was thinking about this over the weekend. I was/am an NT developer. However, I am currently working on an OSS based project, FreeBSD and Linux, in doing so, my existence is (for the time being) 100% Microsoft free. I feel liberated. I somehow feel that better all around. I am forced to wonder. When I was doing NT exclusively, I had been working in a Windows environment for some time. I originated in UNIX, started doing DOS stuff, then Windows, then NT. I found that Windows and NT was all I was used to. I resisted going back to UNIX. I didnt want to because ""Windows NT"" was the future. I rationalized why NT was better, I could argue with the best UNIX guys. Then it happened. I had to use FreeBSD and NetBSD to access a networked thin client. A dec shark. It was difficult to setup, net-boot packages always are. Then I started to remember how fun UNIX was and how much one could get done easily. I noticed all the good programs were running on Linux, and Linux emulation (at that time I guess) was not great. So, I started using Linux. That was 1996. (I had seen Linux a few years earlier but it was too primitive then) I currently do every thing except Windows developement on Linux. (And I think wine will allow me to do NT development on Linux pretty soon!) I wonder how many NT developers would feel the same way, given the right opportunity?

587,"'Can anyone tell me if I should learn C or C++ first?I have to teach myself and I cant get any college courses. Here are some factors to consider: There are excellent free compilers available for both. There are far more good books about C than about C++, especially for novice programmers. There is (so far) a lot more sample code, helpful web sites, programmer utilities, and other useful goodies available for C than C++, though the gap is closing. Any C++ programmer can help you with C. Many C programmers cannot help you with C++ (unless they are also C++ programmers). C++ is a much larger language than C. Almost everything you learn about C is applicable to C++, but only a small part of C++ is relevant to C. Because C is a much smaller language, it takes much less time to learn. C++ has largely replaced C in general-purpose programming, and jobwise, you almost have to learn C++ eventually. So consider these things and use your best judgment.

I learned that I have Small Cell Carcinoma in the advanced stage. I was mortified; what did I do to deserve such a disease? After extensive research, I discovered how I had set myself up for getting lung cancer. Smoking for thirty years, starting when I was just fifteen years old. Back then smoking was the in-thing to do; everybody smoked. Today, driving a truck, I was smoking three packs a day. Only diet rivals tobacco smoke as a cause of cancer in the U.S., accounting for a comparable number of fatalities each year. Animal (saturated) fat in general and red meat in particular are associated with several cancers; both are strongly linked to malignancies of the colon and rectum; saturated fats have been implicated in prostate cancer as well. The food from our diet is high in fat, salt and chemicals. On the road we dont get enough exercise, and we gain weight. I know I gained 45 pounds.

You said: Therefore the only way for the authors of these theories to convince the physics community would be to do some calculations which were never done before. Patently untrue. I will give you two (but not the total derivative basis in this post, MKSC units are used herein). First, in the material medium model elemental charge (e) can be defined as Div p, where p is the momentum potential at any point in the medium (this give it units of kg/sec). Now, if charge has units of kg/sec, the charge to mass (m) ratio (e/m) has resulting units of frequency. So Luc, what IS the black body temperature equal to e/m for the lowly electron (care to take a guess?). Second, with units of kg/sec we can now devine heretofore unknown relationships, like the basis for the thermal-electric coupling. A.k.a. Boltzmanns constant k is: h k = -= 1.38E-23 m-sec2 ec Yielding units of kg-m/sec3 for Kelvins (commonly called impact). If you think about that, it makes perfect sense.

The problem with open source software is that there is no money in it. Speaking from experience - programmers like to eat, have a house, car, etc. I dont want to spend months of my life working on a software product and then just give it away. You think that Red Hat isnt free because it is sold in shrink wrap for $50, and you want to talk about Open Source as if you know something? Take a hike, Mr. Speaking From Experience, nobody wants to discuss the future of open source with someone who wouldnt know it if it bit him on the leg. I am sorely disappointed in your reaction. Explain to the man. He has a first impression that often hit is someone when looking in on the open source community. Anyway Dave: RedHat and these other corps that create linux distros make money off packaging a conveniently shrink wrapped linux version for you with quick start guides etc and they also offer you tech support as a part of the purchase agreement. OTOH, if you buy a $2 CD, then you only have a CD and you are on your own. No-one is obligated to help you with anything. An enterprise will not use an operating system where there isnt a source of reliable and competent tech support. RedHat is one of the suppliers of this tech support for a fee. What do they do with the money for these tech support charges? Well they put food on the table and also employ developers to enhance their distro to make it even more appealing to the public/enterprises who are interested in deploying linux. This is the source of fuel for the development of, for example, KDE and Gnome. So, in the end, their current customers are happy with the enhancements, they attract new customers and the whole OSS community benefits from these enhancements.

646,"'The interference you are receiving may not be in violation of any law, but it I will bet it is very annoying. There are several things you can do to try to protect your TV reception. If you are on cable; call the cable company to have them check the system. Check all the jumpers between your VCR and TV and cable box and disconnect anything connected to the TV one at a time. Often the VCR is prone to RFI rather than the TV. If you are not on cable, attach a good HI-Pass filter between the antenna and TV. Get square ferrite chokes from radio shack and wrap all of your cables in them. Try to determine where the RF is getting into your system. Is it the AC line, the antenna line, or do you have extension speakers, or a Home Theater sound system hooked to your TV? Any of these paths can be vulnerable. Start by just watching the TV alone with nothing else in line. Ask your neighbor politely if he will assist in the testing process. He may be a completely legal operator, in which case, YOU need to prevent the interference to your unprotected devices. Contact the manufacturer of your TV. Often they have kits you can install to prevent RFI. The FCC has an interference handbook available, which has lots more ideas. You can probably get info on it at the FCC website. Good Luck!

Of course, I know you meant ""graphical web page creation"", but I just thought I would point out that WYSIWYG HTML does not exist, nor has it ever existed :) BTW, let us not forget the range of web page creation software which already exists on the Amiga. The Built With Amiga Software site has pointers to a variety of such tools from several authors (hey, you knew I left that open for you my friend. :) Hoping you would take the ball and run . Mind you, personally I just use GoldEd and hsc - a more powerful combination for website creation I have yet to find on any platform, in all honesty! :) Good combo, but then start making interactive sites with hundreds of pages. Knowing that you can cut and paste, throw templates across multiple pages in one pass, support nested tables and layers properly, etc makes a growing site like Owlnet turn from an abomination to do into something much easier. I agree that smaller sites with less than 15 pages are fun to code by hand, but add another 100 plus pages to that with limited time to get them all out and you can see my frustration. Dream Weaver, for instance, can take a template site wide in about 1 minutes with a large site, almost as a batch process. Now do that by hand to change one silly thing ""like copyright 1998-1999"" to ""copyright 1998-2000"" and do it over 150-200 pages. :( Gary Peake, TAC-OwlNet.Net Team AMIGA Central We provide free web sites for small developers Sometimes you are the windshield, sometimes you are the bug!'",0
651,"'Hello Daniel. When I looked at your site the first time, I indeed missed something. Without really looking closelly, I saw your motion picture as push gravity. Never the less, I still have some reservations. The major one is, that you are producing ever bigger gravitons, which themselves do not have any justification for their speed. Should you use the same principle for them as you use for the photon, you would end up with an infinite fractal sequence of particles. No matter how you skin it, the energy of your interaction must come from somwhere. If you take it from the gravitons, your gravitons will loose their speed on every interaction. I would say that your gravitation should be less on a dayside than on your night side. Another point is the redshift of photon. If it were accelerated instantly by the gravitons, there would be no reason for it. I would almost say that the light should have only one frequency, as your gravitons are supplying energy in abundance. I will have to chew on this one, though. One thing seems to be in contradiction with the approach. It looks like an electron recoils when it radiates a photon. That would mean that the instant speed of light is given by the photon dynamics, rather than being result of interaction with gravitation. Mind you, this is orthodox stuff. But I dont think that they are completely wrong on everything. They do deserve a lot of credit. Otherwise, it seems that you followed the same path for your argumentation that I did, which is common sense. That argumentation of yours is better than anything I have seen so far, and logical all right. Regards Slavek.'",0

When we are talking about deaths from woodsmoke, we are talking about places with an extremely low level of technology. Providing efficient stoves would be a far more realistic solution to this problem. In practice it is likely that efficient stoves could be produed locally (from clay or even unburnt earth) at a tiny fraction of the cost of a swish stainless steel job. The Swedes could afford to donate efficient stoves to the poorest of the poor if they chose to meet their Kyoto targets by using nuclear power rather than more expensive alternatives. They might even be able to donate nuclear power plants to run stainless steel stove factories. There is a certain national pride of self-sufficiency though, so I suppose local coal will be preferred to foreign uranium as the stainless steel stove factory fuel of choice. All the more reason why those who can use uranium should use uranium to make more room in the atmospheric CO2 store for those who cant or wont. No, the only argument for nuclear is in those countries which a) can afford it, having surplus GNP to invest Including China, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, . Indonesia just built a huge new coal plant for the same money they could have had a nuclear plant. b) already are producing such unreasonable quantities of CO2 that they need to reduce them, and Most of the CO2 in the next century (which is most of the CO2 expected to be produced under b.a.u.) will come from developing countries, not developed countries. c) are politically capable of taking on board such a curates egg. ?

I have heard Linux is incredibly stable. read an article about a guy that has run it for over 2 years without a stall. 5) win98 sets up like a pair of silk panties. very smooth. nt isnt bad either, but takes a bit of tweaking. I had to manually install my sound and video drivers, and the plug n play service. I heard BeOS has the best set-up program. 6) personally, I have a dual boot system, with win98 for games, nt for real work. since I am not in a mission critical enterprise, I will probably upgrade to win2k as soon as the final release comes out. I say this because of that old rule if it aunt broke dont fix it, and upgrading to win2k from an operating nt4 system would be foolhardy in a mission critical enterprise. unless the risks of a more user friendly os outweigh the risks of using a new, less-extensively tested one.'",1

728,"'This is a message from Paul Lesurf of Blittersort posted to the Fusion Mailing List; To all Amiga emulation users, Blittersoft would like to make a statement regarding the response to the Fusion PPC Amiga situation. Whilst Microcode Solutions announced the 60 day countdown on September 20th, there was not the required 500 prepayments that were supposed to trigger this. As announced by Microcode Solutions, Blittersoft made the commitment for 500 orders to enable this product to actually see the light of day. This was made with some confidence given the many users who stated they would pay after the countdown began. Unfortunately, despite over 600 pledges, we have seen about a third actually prepay. Many have declined to authorise and the situation is that we have backed this process believing the Amiga community who made a commitment would actually follow through and keep their word. This is despite the countdown being close to half way. Whilst I accept that there will be those who circumstances may effect the ability to complete their pledge, I think it is fair to say that this would cater for a handful. It is sad to report that many people who pledged must have done so without ever considering the consequences of failing to meet this pledge. Well, the consequences are that Blittersoft will not make this type of gesture again. The same situation could well happen with the PCx PC software. Again, there have been many requests (about 350) and it is Microcodes intention is to begin the countdown for this after the Fusion PPC is released and 500 pledges become 500 payments. Blittersoft will be prepared to make the same gesture and back the product to the tune of 500 orders if we receive the level of support promised by the Amiga emulation community. Everyone knows the situation with Amiga development. Piracy is still a big problem and now it seems that even planned schemes to secure development can also not be trusted. The bottom line is that the Amiga needs quality support by it is users if there is still to be quality development. I will end with a simple request: If you did pledge your suppport to pre-pay Fusion PPC and have not done so, please reconsider and do so now.

I was just waiting to see if you would come up with anything before I laid the results on you. I searched several engines. I came up with only one example of a ""hate crime"" allegedly faked by blacks to gain sympathy reported in reputable news media. It occurred in Ohio. One other such faked crime, supposedly against a crossdresser, was not particularly credible (there was the little problem that there was no suspect and no victim, because the ""victim"" ran away before police could question him). Not surprisingly, several racist and anti-Semitic pages (incluing Hoffmans newsletter) popped up here and there, but I discount those out of hand. I was looking for reliable sources. Also, specifically, I failed to find a single piece demonstrating that the FAMU bombing was faked. It has been asserted that ""many"" hate crimes are ""faked"" to gain sympathy and publicity and implied that the FAMU bombings were also ""faked."" I could find only one credible example of a faked hate crime reported from a reliable source. (Even in that case there has not been a conviction yet, and it is not certain that there will be.) The assertion has been made that there are ""many,"" and you keep saying to ""look it up."" Well, I did ""look it up."" Maybe I did or maybe I didnt use good search strategies or the right search engines. it is possible I missed something, but the fact that only one convincing page came up makes me think that there probably arent that many examples of faked hate crimes, because when I search for a topic or incident for which there are many examples I usually get deluged in web pages. If you want to prove your point, it is now up to you to come up with the evidence that there are ""many"" faked hate crimes.

I should have written that the balance wheel is positioned coaxial with the axis of the watch, as I found state in the original text when I got around to looking it up. (The balance wheel itself is a type of torsion pendulum, the same thingies that played such a major role in the solution of the longitude problem in global navigation.) That refers to a spring and rotating mass that takes the place of a pendulum. It rotates back and forth as a simple harmonic oscillator, and near the end of each ""swing"" knocks a pawl out of the tooth on a ratchet, and knocks another pawl into place so the ratchet can turn by one click. The rate that the clock moves is pretty much equal to the period of the balance wheel. Think you can do the problem now? Hmm. First of all, I never learned what a ""pawl"" is - it is one of those words like ""gimbal"" and ""sprocket"" that for some weird reason people always say right before I tune out and stop paying attention. For some people, mathematics jargon has this effect - for me, it is gadget jargon. So all I know about ""pawls"" is what you just told me. That doesnt matter because it doesnt enter the first order periodicity computation. It does have rather nasty second order effects however, since it determines the amplitude of the balance wheels (pendulums) oscillation.

Also assuming the SW3dpro.vxd is located in the file you mentioned (will search for it after unpacking, and drop it in the system directory if not already there). Dang it how -do- you find all this stuff so easily at Microsoft??! (hehe). Matt 1) Download 2) Run/install SWGameEN.exe (version 3.02) 3) Then copy SW3dpro.vxd to the windows system dir. Then the OS will see the game controller! Hope this helps! P.S. Microsoft committed a large gaffe by not including this vxd file with Win98SE. It is for everybody who uses WIN98 (SE too!) and whos joystick is listed as ""not connected"". The updated virtual display driver is called sw3dpro.vxd version 3.00.01. One should also download the latest game controller software: SWGameEN.exe (version 3.02) Thanks for posting some filenames; time to ""venture"" into MS-world, and find this sucker. For some reason, I have a really hard time finding anything at MS, file-name searches always seem to give ""zero"" results. Btw, I found the same filename with HotBot, but am not sure it is the lastest driver. it is worth the try though, will get the file from HotBot and see if it is v3.02 or newer (about 6mb DL).

763,"'A further point is that not only would a drum recorder prevent signals being missed when the instrument isnt being watched, it would also provide permanent records that could be passed around to interested parties. Roger Musson Some time ago Dennis posted that it was _not possible_ (due to their inherent nature) to record the signals. From the context, it was quite clear that it was not due to any lack of equipment or funds, but that it was some feature of the signals themselves that prevented recording. Nobody really seemed to pick up on that, but it seemed like an extremely odd assertion to me. And so far nobody has asked (so far as I know) for a very general description of the nature of the emanations. Seems to me that he would not give the game away too much by just indicating whether they are electromagnetic, seismic, barometric, sonic, psychic, tidal, astronomical, or what. Dennis has taken interest in his theory to be evidence of support for his prediction aspirations. I shall quite honestly admit what I think others know of themselves. I am searching for a handhold with which to further skewer this pretender (sincere, but deluded). But he is extremely slippery. Dennis - are your signals produced by some force or energy heretofore undiscovered by science? Are they one (or more) of those listed above? Without this information, it will be very hard for scientists to provide any support whatsoever (considering the current lack of statistical, methodological or other evidence regarding your speculations).

This bothered me a little some 30-odd years ago, when somebodys exegesis of the _Tractatus_ claimed that LW blew RD away by stating that the ""I"" in ""I think"" was simply a linguistic embellishment to call attention to the speaker. And now here is the perfect forum in which to bring it up. it is an interesting idea.

770,"'Theory of Evolution works as follows: Even Christians acknowlege micro-evolution.the tendancy for creatures to adapt to their environment through changes in the gene pool. They deny MACRO evolution, that is, one species change to the next. Most of this is a failure to understand what macro-evolution is. One Christian gentleman I spoke to thought it was ""The Theory that man decended from apes."" Not quite. Evolutionary theory says that man and monkey are cousins on the tree, not father-son. The stipulation makes sense because humans and the greater apes share nearly 99% of their genetic code. Before there were men, or women, or apes, there was something that was sorta monkey like. Some of it is decendants had to stay in the trees and eat fruit to survive. Over millions of years, they became modern apes. Others were forced to go hunting on the plains, and use tools and fire. These lost their body hair, gained inteligence, and grew eventually into mankind. This did not happen overnight. Any casual observer would be long dead before any noticable changes happened. Basically, macro evolution is repeated separated micro-evolution until the two groups of creatures can no longer interbreed. Scientists call this Speciation. The last thing I have wondered is why Christians refuse to accept evolution, as if it were forbidden by their god or something. Could it be that the christian god is influencing evolution to create creatures in his favor? it is worse than that. Those Christians of the ""Young-Earth"" variety contradict themselves frequently on micro and macro. They claim macro is impossible, yet to make the ark ""work"" they limit the number of animals to ""kinds"" then promote RAPID mutation rates to change the generic ""bear"" kind into black bears and polar bears and kodiak bears and even kuala bears in less than 6000 years.

If it involves the creation of molecules which remain, then your dream has gained weight. If it involves the destruction of molecules to leave behind traces of their change, then your dream has lost weight. If it involves merely the rearrangement of atoms on molecules, then your dream can still be said to have gained weight by the assignment of those molecules to your dream (this also reverses the net effect of the molecular disintegration paradigm mentioned just previously). However, there is at least one cat around here (Hi, Jack!) who will tell you (but you wont understand) that thought is primarily a quantum process, so youd have to get into the assignment of photonic energy, which according to Einstein still represents mass, if not ""weight"".

Hello, we are three physics students at the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg in Germany, and in our free time, we have tried to reproduce an alleged ""antigravity"" experiment. Maybe some of you have heard of Podkletnov, who reported to have measured a ""gravity shielding"" effect about a huge, rotating superconductor. As often broadcasted in the German TV, there is also a simplified version of the experiment, called Schnurers experiment. At the URL we give a report about our 2 weeks of attempts to reproduce Schnurers gravity shielding effect. Our result: The effect is not antigravity at all, it is simply bouyancy. We are no professionals (at that time, we did not even know how to calculate the average error etc.), but the result is quite obvious, and maybe the web site is interesting for those who have been heard of these antigravity experiments before.

817,"'Which is more efficient at producing energy from the sun? Would it make sense to let plants collect the sunrays and then perform chemical processes on the plants to extract the energy? Z Do you mean like growing trees and burning the wood? : Sure but it takes a fair bit of effort to get the plant energy into forms readily usable by society, on top of the fact that the best land for growing many plants is often where we want to grow food. But to answer your first question IIRC the efficiency of the best solar cells is now somewhere in the vicinity of a bit over 20% (I am sure someone will correct me by posting the latest record or something : ) but I dont know what the equivalent figure is for plants. I imagine it depends on the type of plant and how it is used for energy, e.g. corn turned into ethanol gives one efficiency, trees turned into firewood another, but I really dont know for sure. You also have to figure in the energy required to produce the energy (manufacturing solar cells versus planting, havesting, processing, etc. for plants) if you want the total picture. At this time there is some energy produced both ways, so they are technically feasible in some sense, but neither has been cheap enough to gain a large market share. I dont know about % comparative effectiveness - water hyacinth growing under optimum conditions is capable of producing 96 tons of dry matter per acre per year which is a pretty good conversion equivalent to about 25,000 gallons - really not that bad a conversion rate if it wasnt for the excess water problem - some algae have an ever higher conversion rate Nature limits what we can do, Science limits what we understand, Theory what we can think, and Religion what we can hope "" Lindaberry 1998 RESEARCH GOES WHERE RESEARCH LEADS Regards, Russell Martin'",0

There are incantantions to force such expressions to be evaluated at run-time using IEEE semantics, but it would certainly help if the default handling of such cases defaulted to the same behaviour for all compilers.

The government has approximately 12,000,000 in the armed services. This is a very, very rough guess. In Michigan alone on opening day of deer season there is an estimated 1,000,000 plus hunters out there ready to go. This number does not take into account how many other people have guns personally nor does it take into account how many people are armed in other states. There are iirc 400,000 standing Marines currently enlisted. These Marines are trained to protect the Citizens and the Constitution against all threats both foreign and domestic. Finally there was a survey done about 4 years ago of the armed services in which the military was asked, ""Would they fire upon a US citizen if ordered to"". 60% replied they would not and of those 60%, 85% said they would actively defend the citizens against those trying to carry out such an order. The 12,000,000 available is now down to 4,800,000 with approximately the same number of their fellow servicemen willing to stop them. These numbers dont include all the retired Marines and other military personel who would fight for the Citizens and not the government.

The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product, like cotton, would turn into an insect-resistant, herbicide-resistant, uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae, so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae, and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae, what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ (the water flea) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff (like fish) eat the mosquito larvae, the _Daphnia_, etc. If this organism gets out of control, it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon, I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle, because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels, like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment, which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible.'",0

I recently upgraded my computer system from an old P90 system to a 350 PII one by moving the hard-drives (a 2 gig and a 1 gig) and other useful cards from the old box to the new box. No problems there. OS/2 handled it beautifully. However. Now the computer store has convinced me that I should turn the old P90 box into a Linux box, and sold me the required hardware which included an 8 gig Harddrive (Smallest one they had on the shelves!

(I am a Linux idiot, so I want something familiar to fall back on). Problems now. 1) The Bios wont auto detect past 2 gigs. It has 3 settings for a 2 gig HD (normal, Large, LBA), if I can partition the HD to an intial 2 gig size, can I use the Bios anyway? It is an old (1995) Award Bios. I have updated the OS/2 Install diskettes with the FDISK and IBM1S506.ADD on my boot partition. I am hoping that if I can install OS/2 in the first 1024 cylinders that it will look beyond the 2 gigs that the BIOS is limited to. Is this right? My thinking is that if I can get BootManager and/or LILO to install in the first part of the HD then I can install Data and Swap partitions in the other part.

The operative words are ""small"", ""routine"" and ""excerpt."" You need to isolate the smallest possible example that exhibits the problem. Then it will be a lot easier to get help. Usually, when I have a problem such as yours, and I isolate the example as described, by the time I get a small example that works, I understand the problem. it is nearly always some problem in my code. The fact that some compilers accept it anyway is irrelevant. OTOH, if the compiler is really at fault, the small excerpt will make that obvious. I support a large code that has been ported to just about every commercial UNIX. Despite every attempt to write portable code, there are bugs in the code that turn up with every port. There are occasionally compiler bugs that turn up too, and one time there was even a problem that have turned up where the F90 standard was not completely clear, and the compiler implementer interpreted it one way and I interpreted it another way. (They ended up agreeing with me on that one, BTW. : ) But in many cases, understanding could not have been achieved working on the whole code. Since you know your code better than anyone else, you are in the best position to carry out this process of simplification.

The long answer is NEVER trust a ""utility"" vendor that oohs and aaahs over how pretty its screens are and never ever instructions you on the correct method of doing a backup.

Getting even with divinity for the alleged creation and bringing us into a torturous life. Thusly putting divinity in the lap of a virgin, torturing, crucifying and killing then resurrecting and asking for salvation. Sexual frustration as well is deeply rooted in religions. Making ""GOD"" a male entity is sexual projection from both sexes not from males only. Eve eats from the forbidden tree but ""God"" stays silent, blind and deaf. Yet when she gives Adam to eat and he does, Pops up the GOD for challenge, male to male. Adam defied Gods will. So, as far as proving the fallacy of religions at any time, is very easy. You are skeptic about disproving the fact of divinity in the primordial sense. Here I have to agree because the basis of consciousness and self awareness of life must have its roots in the primordial fabric from which we are made into the zenith of complexity. So, such a divinity is inseparable from beingness but does not interfere like complex beings except through complex beings.

914,"'(big cut) Since you (e.g., Charliew) work for an oil company, how do you feel about what is happening in Nigeria?.the people starving while those who run the place gather their millions/billions (along with Shell and BP Amoco?) Do oil companies not have consciences?.apparently not Do the people who work for oil companies have consciences? I will let you answer that one. The last time I checked, it was the function of government to ensure a system of laws and procedures that allowed people to survive and prosper. Why isnt the Nigerian government taxing the oil companies in order to support its population? Whether or not you realize it, Jean, it is the primary function of corporations to maximize their profits for their stockholders. This is more amoral than immoral, but corporations are NOT legally, ethically, or morally bound to provide for the populations of foreign governments. If you think otherwise, you are living in a fantasy world. So what happens when certain nations cry ""free trade, free trade"" over and over again to the WTO in order to erode government control over social matters? What happens when consumers are duped into believing (or willingly adopt the belief) that the products they buy are made under acceptable conditions, when they simply arent. This Christmas, will you be buying your kids toys made in Chinese sweatshops? If the sweatshop toy is $5 cheaper than the others, how about then? I bet you wouldnt even know which is which. If corporations have no responsibility to conduct their operations in a responsible way (environmentally, socially, and fiscally) then we are well and truly screwed as a society. If corporations had an advertising budget of zero, then I would buy your claim that they are amoral. But when they actively promote certain behaviours in the market, they bring 1 million consumers along for the moral ride too. Corporations are responsible for the human conditions they create where they do business. One other thing . if you think the oil firms arent aiding and abetting the Nigerian govt (paying their ""processing fees"" and ""hidden taxes"") then you are the one living in a fantasy world. \\ Thomas Rohricht - CO2 Creative environmentally sensitive graphics and design ""I wouldnt mind having multiple personalities, just so long as they all got along and could work together on a project"" - anonymous - \\'",1

918,"'One aspect of the groundfighting vs. standup fighting argument which is often overlooked is energy expenditure, and how this differs in each realm. One of the things that a groundfighter knows which stand-up fighters or untrained people dont realize is the fact that it is very exhausting to fight on the ground against a person who knows position maintenance. I know wat you mean, my schools ground-grappling included some monkey stuff that focuses on wearing out your opponent. Works pretty well until the eye gouges start. Consistently, I have heavyweight athletes come in who have very good standing endurance (from running, standup M.A. training, etc.) and they are completely gassed on the ground in about 20 seconds even when facing a trained opponent whom they heavily outweigh. They are always surprised when they first experience this. We had some guys start running to improve their endurace during sparring, but it didnt really help. What they dont understand is the fact that real groundfighting has unique rigors to it. Even people who dabble in groundfighting and grappling dont understand this. Good stand-up fighting does too (that grappling/impact/elbow stand-up, not standing off trading blows (that IS more like the running stamina)) People who train in stand-up fighting, lift weights, run, etc. generally have pretty good standing endurance. They can explode, and send their natural weapons (e.g. fists) trajectorally toward a target, they can move and shuffle, advance, retreat. They do just fine here. I find that even these wight-trained people lack endurance. We get them down thighs paralell and they run out of steam fast. So, grappling works against both the standing mans instincts and his conditioned actions and responses. So then. If a person demonstrates the ability to knock your head off while standing, and you cant match this ability in return, you can take all of this away from him by taking him to the ground. He wont have the same leverage or knowledge to do what he wants to do once you take it to the ground. Moreover, he wont find this out until it is already too late. Take a standup fighter to the ground. Good strategy. Opposite strateg, make a grappler face you upright. (cant keep him upright, but you can trow stuff at him then) This says nothing of multiple opponent strategies, etc. The above merely describes an important phenomen which can occur in a one on one situation.

I am normally a big naysayer when it comes to conspiracy theories, but this series of events does sound highly suspicious, especially with Snow practicing at full speed the day before he gets put on the injured list. I would not be at all surprised to see Snow land in Boston or Long Island before long, provided Sinden or Milbury can dump their high salaried goalies to someone else. Even if Snow gets dumped to points east, I dont see either Dafoe or Potvin arriving here. (Potvin is a slight possibility forget Dafoe.) I would not be at all surprised to see Burke dump Snow for some youth or draft picks, and just tough out the year with Legace and Weekes. The Canucks are at least a year or two away from contending, Haha and they can address their goaltending needs at that time if need be. That would be if the Canucks had Potvin making close to 3 million a year performing worse that Snow did last year, BUT Snow is only making 1.4 mill and without him you can expect the Canucks to finish with less that the 62 or 63 points they got last year, I promise that! In the meantime, Snow is a highly disposable asset who HUH?!?!?!?! Highly disposable? WHo the fuck is going to take his place? Weak-es? Legace? We dont even know if these guys can handle a full load, or even split one with any ounce of succes. We at least know that Snow can on the odd occasion pull out a win from the winless Canucks hat. He managed 6 shutouts last year on a team that is more hole-y than Pope John Paul II. This team cant score, SO they cant be in the position to gamble in the nets. Snow proved himself last year, and the inconsistency we saw was CONSISTENT with the rest of the team, so what do you expect to happen to your goalie? Fix the defence, and get some scoring.

If it is toxic to other forms, then there will be a problem. 9 out of 10 voices in my head say I am not crazy, so there. reply to squale5atgodotcom Up till now, I hadnt heard about any GM products that concerned me about their safety. A few transplanted genes arent going make a tomato feel pain or let you squeeze blood from a turnip. The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product, like cotton, would turn into an insect-resistant, herbicide-resistant, uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae, so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae, and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae, what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ (the water flea) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff (like fish) eat the mosquito larvae, the _Daphnia_, etc. If this organism gets out of control, it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon, I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle, because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels, like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment, which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible.'",0
