I find it's always people who have never experienced the system that advocate for penalties hugely out of proportion with the crime.

There's nothing more to be gained from increased harshness of punishment, only negatives like resentment.

46,"So just to be clear : About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1. The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised. The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront. Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war). Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage. She suffered no real risk. She just had to complain to the men in power. And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it. These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists. A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign). While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote. We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or proto-feminists, who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court disagreed. Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""] Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud. In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight. These included conscientious objectors from religious groups. (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz). The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so. Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered. Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male. Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy. Moreover it encourages ""gender equality."" Honestly, I don't feel hate. I just feel shame and disgust. Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.",clear million men teenaged boys died fighting majority men right vote suffrage europe contingent property ownership working class men enough property enfranchised mountains upon mountains straight white male corpses propelled universal suffrage movement forefront women achieved vote upon mountains dead males europe us see civil war single woman actually fight suffrage suffered real risk complain men power patriarchs government gave women vote conscription obligations that equality that chivalry soon majority said wanted it men boys suffered worst deaths humanly imaginable guts blown trenches inhaling poison gas eaten alive rats crucified barbed wire privileged according feminists sizable percentage feminists time period actually encouraged men boys vote go die trenches protect female honor see white feather campaign suffragists demanded universal suffrage suffragettes wanted rich white women men vote celebrate latter former former draw question feminist mythology edit women time period often described feminists proto feminists consistent eg american anarchist emma goldman whom i quite sure would appalled modern feminism helped mount legal challenge arguing conscription violation amendment prohibition involuntary servitude supreme court disagreed ironically goldman considered suffragettes bunch spoiled brats famously claimed if voting changed anything they make illegal hundreds thousands men executed front lines prevent desertion even though historians agree many wwi campaigns useless suicide missions men knew it deserters right throw lives away patch mud us men imprisoned tortured even executed refusing fight included conscientious objectors religious groups two men hutterite brothers tortured death alcatraz majority american men fought wwi effectively forced so far americans fought wwi conscripted volunteered today little rich girls would living gutter without benefaction rich daddies living caves without benefaction men group condemn powerless white men boys hundred years ago died eaten alive rats crying mothers white male yes perfectly sane society feminism perfectly sane philosophy moreover encourages gender equality honestly feel hate feel shame disgust shame feminism done society disgust men women allowed happen ,0

Not an emergency. You do not have calibrated eyes to test for speeds. You call the police directly and not the emergency line. Every highway has deaths on them from speeding it's not something special or new or important or even close to an emergency.

That kind of call frequency of non-emergency on the emergency line is fucking stupid. 10 days in jail though it's kinda not long at all but then again unless someone was actually harmed because of her shitty work ethic, i'm not sure a longer prison sentence would be worth it.

163,"Well said. Not at all crowdsourced. Not at all organic. SocJus is a specific, intentional, contrived post-religious faith. It was formed to create the base rank and file of useful idiots in a grand Alinsky strategy. They only thing crowdsourced about SJWs are how their norming dynamic works. They appear to be ""crowdsourcing"" recruitment or blue-pilling, or whatever. But, in fact, they don't convince anyone that way. SJWs are indoctrinated into the faith almost exclusively in college...a few in primary schools. (It is the academics who are the top of this whole insurgency). I suspect the confusion about crowdsourcing is simply a confusion with how this vulnerable group of mostly Millennial-aged young adults seek to enforce and maintain community norms upon one another. Thus, the twatter dogpile. Pretty much all other age-cohorts lack this dynamic by a large degree, including the generation following the Millennials...so it's not just a function of age/tech. Something very specific happened to Millennials, mostly in college, which radicalized them philosophically -- and which conditioned them to a permanent state of cyber-witch-hunts. Gen X missed out on this, so mostly ignore or evade it (from without). Boomers, well, .... meh.

[Here](@USER is a video from a different perspective showing the head-first body slam. Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to 0:30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective accomplished, and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or pussypasses. It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their head. American football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest 9 times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay?

241,"I'll copy/paste my [comment](@USER Yeah, that guy's annoying. From what I've seen, the article on it was accurate. In fact, I read more or less most of the report myself. Now, what's discussed in this video is this article : @USER Which I've previously ignored (because I've read the source). At the time the story came out, they put out 4-5 articles (I don't get it either, so don't ask me), and this article has had all of... 371 comments. The article I've read, however, has - up to now - 14,101 comments: @USER And it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article : > Page 14 of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now control the majority of our conversations, but that these platforms “ including Google “ must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content neutrality. And this: > Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create well-ordered spaces for safety and civility rather than unmediated marketplaces of ideas. Personally, I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately : > The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the unmediated marketplace of ideas vs. well-ordered spaces for safety and civility. > The first approach is described as a product of the American tradition which prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility. The second is described as a product of the European tradition, which favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom. The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition. ""Claims x is the case,"" obviously isn't the same as ""argues x should happen."" And: > The briefing associates Googles new role as the guarantor of civility with the categories of editor and publisher. The only line I'm not sure would be this : > For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to expand globally. It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say ""argues."" For example: > US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the world. Another thing he objects to is ""Google admits."" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the ""Insights Lab"" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's ""internal research,"" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article : > Perhaps they buy Googles explanation that the presentation was just research and doesnt reflect official Google positions ” a confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers assessment of where the company is headed? I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh. Also this: @USER",i copy paste comment yeah guy annoying i seen article accurate fact read less report myself now what discussed video article i previously ignored because i read source time story came out put articles i get either ask me article of comments article i read however comments accurate person video objects to parts article page document acknowledges silicon valley tech giants control majority conversations platforms including google must break initial promise users free speech content neutrality this google argues briefing must move towards european tradition create well ordered spaces safety civility rather unmediated marketplaces ideas personally i first contact person wrote it but that me since person wrote several articles well article one read notes accurately briefing argues google facebook youtube twitter caught two incompatible positions unmediated marketplace ideas vs well ordered spaces safety civility first approach described product american tradition prioritizes free speech democracy civility second described product european tradition favors dignity liberty civility freedom briefing claims tech platforms moving toward european tradition claims x case obviously argues x happen and briefing associates googles new role guarantor civility categories editor publisher line i sure would example briefing argues tech companies censor platforms want expand globally mention twice i sure i say argues example us based monopolies already tempted compromise order gain entrance vast fast growing markets dictatorial leaders countries may happy collaborate since want improve methods control populations expand power influence united states rest world another thing objects google admits see might misleading however i say depends whether insights lab outside google another user notes seem case is yeah misleading might be user says there link goes back google say internal research necessarily misleading here breitbart said recent article perhaps buy googles explanation presentation research doesnt reflect official google positions confusing explanation research official google positions google disagreeing researchers assessment company headed i still suggested contacting author article first eh also this ,0

425,"Let's bring it back to the gaming aspect for a moment. (Disclaimer, the following response is not to the guy I am responding to, but to the mindset of the writer in a specific situation.) ""I enjoy videogames, but I'm not good at it and I don't want to be"" Alright then. Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. Multiplayer. At all. Play Singleplayer games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow. Make it fun for you, because singleplayer is ALL about you. Multiplayer isn't. If you do not want to shoot for greatness, if you do not want to become better at it, do not play multiplayer. Especially not with that attitude. If you ""do not want to be good"" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit. Same as a guy who, for example, during a group project would do fuck all, then lose the data he was asked to get and claim that the whole thing was his idea in the first place when it comes to presenting it, you will get a nice variation of ""fuck you, fuck your face, fuck your attitude and get fucked by the horse you rode in on you fuck"". Do not expect a pat on the head, a cookie and a participation trophy for ruining the fun of other people. You do NOT matter more than them and not giving the best you got and not actively trying to get better is an insult to your team.

447,"I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it. There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western Massachusetts, mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was disproportionately burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley. Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people (overwhelmingly men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book ""The Jungle""? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book. If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket science. Incidentally, the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before. Right? If you look, you find all of the early women's rights heroines (who struggled!) *nearly all* of them came out of middle class households of the Victorian era. That was the first large group of women in human history to have free time. Consider the significance of that.",assume talking us history and leaving aside gross murderous injustices slave system book itself aware voting rights white men involved property restrictions random example rhode island unpropertied men raised militia violence dorr rebellion took decades property restrictions lifted men slow unsexy process gf probably never heard it plenty men rebellions economic injustices ever heard shays rebellion broke right american revolution western massachusetts mainly poor farmers whiskey rebellion poor farmers western pennsylvania one item could sell whiskey government put tax whiskey disproportionately burdensome them spared taxation men anti rent war upstate ny poor farmers revolted kind semi feudal landlord system hudson river valley aware labor history us violent labor history working people overwhelmingly men clamored things like hour work week weekends off girlfriend like weekend off assume does think male capitalists freely gave male workers days because men read book the jungle jurgis exactly living high hog book homework see rights benefits never gifted common men qua men often struggle involved powerful men favor less powerful men factory owner likely spend money fur coat wife parcel benefits men factory floor rocket science incidentally leaders early women movement seneca falls comfortably middle class at least support husbands oh and servants sometimes servants too instance elizabeth cady standon lucretia mott met antislavery conference london husbands paid tickets bit rather hard claim oppressed husband buys steamship tickets across atlantic also helps organize first women rights conference experience organizing conferences before right look find early women rights heroines who struggled nearly all came middle class households victorian era first large group women human history free time consider significance that ,0

""ASSAULT WITH HATE CRIME MOTIVE On January 11, 2018, I was on my way home from work at 5.30pm. I was in a hurry to get the son from school closing at 18pm. I'm in a hurry, the train is coming soon. walk through the barriers. A white middle-aged man in front of me, turns around and stops me in the middle of the barriers and says to me ""go on your own card."" I stand between the barriers, they hit me hard in my back. He blocks my way. I ""But I have a card"", and is about to show him, but there is no time to do it. In the next moment, I feel how he grabs me with both arms, squeezes me hard into a corner at the latches, pushes his knee to my body, preventing me from touching and holding me with both arms. I get scared! I push him away with all my power. He gets pissed off and says ""damn dirty N-word hora"" while pushing me so hard that I trip through the barriers. A black man runs forward and tells the white man to stop ""Beat a Woman"". I'm both afraid, angry, offended, shocked, sad and desperate. The man continues to call me N word hora. I defend myself, strikes back! I refuse to be violated, afraid and depressed. Everything is recorded on video. The man reports me for abuse and I am making a counter notification of abuse of hatred motives. A week ago, I received a letter home that my application was canceled but the husband's application to me is not canceled. Suddenly, I'm suspected of abuse. My report is closed because, according to the police, ""it lacks objective evidence of support"". The male's application is not laid down !! The police's racism has already determined that he (white man about 185 cm) is the victim, and I (black woman about 163 cm) is above, despite defending myself in distresses and the man started the attack on me from nowhere! It's me who has back injuries, was hospitalized because of shock, got sick, got colleagues who follow me to the track because I'm afraid to meet the man. It's me who was attacked by unknown white man in the subway, and subjected to an afrophobic hate crime. The police never investigated my notification as a hate crime and they never registered the hate crime scene before my notification was downloaded. In Sweden, about 25% of all racist hatred is avrophobic. The most common hate crime against black people is a violent crime of unknown white man. I am one of those victims who carry on the damage of racism, afrophobia and hate crime that the police are kidding in. I am tired of the institutional racism of the police, everyday racism, hatred and threats against black / brown people. I'm tired of 34 years in Sweden, to constantly bear the blame and become a victim of society's structural racism that permeates all authorities. I am sad that we who are exposed to racism never get settled. But the game must go on !!! SHARE GET!

HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these characteristics. That being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell.

The evidence that he uses is -The voting record of each party on the amendments mentioned in the meme (I do not believe that the numbers are correct, though the ultimate point is. Democrats, in general, were opposed to granting rights to blacks.) - The racist/fascist history of the Democrat party (including voting against the amendments mentioned in the meme.

The passing of the Jim Crowe laws, and more.) - Democrat leaders fascination with fascist/socialist leaders such as Hitler and Mussolini. - Democrat president's racist backgrounds (which includes FDR, Woodrow Wilson, and Andrew Jackson). - How the Democrat party used wellfare to tear apart the family unit of the black population and set up a new, nation-wide plantation for minorities. - How cities and states run by the Democrat party tend to mirror the living conditions of slaves back in the pre-Civil war era. - How no republican ever owned any slaves.

1330,"Among the stupid shit Verhoeven added, changed, or left out to make it look bad. 1. Conscription is banned in the Terran Federation, ( I'm pretty sure it applies to the movie but it is never explicitly stated or stressed ), not only that, but you can quit anytime you want, even right before a combat drop (Though you won't get your citizenship). Heinlein was very critical the American Military's use of conscription and devotes several paragraphs to deconstructing it and even name drops the then contemporary Korean war as an example. All the more ironic when you consider Verhoeven's own misgivings about the american military. 2. In the book, the mobile infantry is an elite army utilizing orbital drop-pods, and power armor with enough fire-power to level city blocks, ( A formation with soldiers a kilometer apart is considered and dangerous risk for friendly fire, and at one point Rico uses mini nukes ) Essentially being WH40K Space Marines in all but name ( Minus genetic modification). That Is why they fight without tanks or artillery, which are explicitly stated to be obsolete compared to an M.I. soldier. The movie instead makes the M.I. look like the WH40k Imperial guard if it was led by Zapp Brannigan, rushing masses of ill equipped soldiers like a moron. 3. You don't need to be a citizen to have children. The only rights a citizen has over a civilian is the right to vote or run for office in the Terran Federation. 4. There are other forms of service apart from the military one can sign up for that will grant citizenship, though they are similarly dangerous, dirty, and grueling. 5. The Bugs are a technologically advanced race with an interstellar empire, not just some wildlife on an isolated planet. The attack on Sao Paulo is most definitely *NOT* a false flag, as the movie implies. 6. No attention is given in the movie to the near non-existance of racism, racial strife or sexism between humans in the Terran Federation. Units are mixed with people from all ethnicities and cultures. The Main character Juan Rico is in fact Filipino, though even book readers might miss this, as it is only inferred through two random lines where he mentions [Ramon Magsaysay](@USER and that he speaks tagalog. Obviously Verhoeven couldn't let people think that anything other than globohomo peace and tolerance hippie ideals will lead to a internally peaceful society. 7. For the M.I. recruiting office, they hire only the most crippled and mangled veterans they can find. The one Juan Rico meets is missing half his face and 3 limbs. His job to scare away anyone who isn't really dedicated and to make it very, very clear what dangerous dirty and grueling life you will have in the M.I. which itself is *extremely* selective, only %9 of Rico's starting group is able to pass and complete training. There is no propaganda machine brainwashing people, and there are no illusions given that service will be anything but dangerous, dirty and grueling.

1493,"Interesting. So the post was only up for 3 minutes, dont know how you expected a huge discussion to have already taken place. But if youre actually interested in an answer I can give that to you. I am the breadwinner in my relationship, and Im a woman. I do feel appreciated, but I havent always. For a while my husband was jobless, and that put a definite strain on me.I work in a very up and down field, I can have a phenomenal week and then a shit one right after. So I guess it was less about feeling under appreciated and more about feeling a ton of stress to provide. Ive always been the breadwinner in our relationship, and I enjoy working and making good money. Actually just this year Ive opened my own business. I dont feel as respected as a breadwinner compared to a male counterpart. Many people I tell ask me how my husband feels, if hes okay with it. Some laugh, others pity me. We are happy with our dynamic and thats all that really matters. I understand you guys have a certain stance about women here.... and there are some women who fit that stereotype. But I encourage you to realize that, like men, we are all different. I dont expect huge gifts from my husband, nor did I ask for a big ring - actually I insisted we purchase fake ones. All this to say, there are great women out there. I know many. Same with men. Youre missing out on the most important human connection if you just write everyone off.

I asked what she was looking for and the list was what you would expect - tall, handsome, good job, own their own home, nice car, ... yadda yadda. She mentioned Tom Ellis from the TV show Lucifer as an example. I asked what she brought to the table to deserve such a paragon, and that completely blew her mind. She had no idea what I meant and couldn't wrap her mind around the idea that she needed to have something to offer. Kept coming back to me and asking what I meant over the course of the afternoon.

1592,"Many years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery. I don't know what the 'rules' are these days ... but she had gone through the entire procedure prior to getting the actual operation. Not the least of which was a lot of therapy and living full time as a woman for a minimum of 12 months. I think it was while we were waiting for her to be taken to theater that we were talking about it, and I asked if she thought the process was too involved. She told me (as best I can recall) that there were times when she felt that it was and was frustrated, but in retrospect that a lot of what was going on was designed to ensure that she was entirely sure about the choice she was making, and as well informed as humanly possible about the consequences. After the surgery (and after she had recovered from the anesthesia which had knocked her around a bit) she was happy. We lost touch a couple of years later, but she was still happy and I hope she still is to this day. I think, as you note, her being happy was because she had been given realistic expectations. Then we see people like Milo Stewart (a transtrender from youtube, if you weren't aware) who just wander off to an 'informed consent' clinic and start hormones with virtually no real preparation. And we see comments saying ""Your so brave"" and ""U r valid"" (yes ... they generally are that illiterate) and then down the track we see them start posting videos like >My Non-Binary Dysphoria Say WHAT? >Asexuality, sex and Kink Which starts with the sentence ""Hi! I'm an asexual and I have a lot of gay sex"". Seriously. >Am I still asexual?! What's my sexual orientation? The gist is ""I no longer identify as asexual"". No shit sherlock. >CONFESSION: I can't orgasm I wonder why? After which Milo had clearly stopped using testosterone and now their voice is all over the place.

Prisons are criminal schools. Plus it costs a lot of money to keep someone in prison.

1688,"I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself. Now many of these people say things like ""so you can believe dragons and not muh female/gay/whatever characters??"", but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain. My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me. The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional companionship. Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws. It takes some self-awareness which a lot of the more SJW-inclined people don't do, because it makes them uncomfortable. So lets just take some women's march gender studies girl, with pink hair, who is vegan and freaks out a lot about random first world things.

They are fundamental to any functioning adult who has an interest or takes part in working/voting society. I got my sociology degree in 2007 from a well-ranked school. Almost all of my classes were very technically oriented towards statistics, survey methodology, use of polling, geospatial information systems. The focus was on preparing students to be able to apply theory, test it, and explain it while giving them some real world skills that could get them jobs. Even then, I could see the postmodernist creep in the form of classes devoted to Derridas or feminist theory injected into Anthropology course material. I cant even imagine how bad it is now.

On one hand, I kinda get why they do this because it's a legal issue. The age of the two main characters here are 16 and 15 and this, **correct me if I'm wrong here**, is considered child porn. Although The UK age of consent is 16, The specific issue is that a 16 year old legal is having sexual relations with a 15 year old who is still a child, a legal-on-nonlegal depiction. Understandable that they would not want to stick their 2-inch pole in this deep, troublesome hole. On the other hand, the real issue lies with the stupid laws and provisions that are in place. They are drawings. Fictional characters. They are not real just like your waifus.Existing for as long as they're drawn. Just because a creator of a work has labelled characters a certain age that should not mean anything. The laws in UK and the general populace mindset regarding this thing need to change as they still treat drawings as having the same rights as a living, breathing, normal people.
